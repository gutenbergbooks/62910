<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span><small>HE</small> hedge had once been full of
trees and bushes, but they were cut
down and nothing now shot up from
their stubs but long, thin twigs.</p>

<p>In between the stubs grew goat&#8217;s-foot
and fool&#8217;s-parsley and more
weeds of the same kind, which all
look like one another and are called
wild chervil by people who know no
better.</p>

<p>Their branches were almost as long
as those of the bushes. And they were
as pretentious as though they really
were bushes and as though they did
not wither in the autumn and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to start all over again with a little
seed, just like some silly daisy or
pansy. They strutted and swaggered,
they rustled in the wind, they
snapped, they lost their leaves and
got new ones, exactly as if their time
were their own. If any one asked
them what they really were, they
pretended not to hear, or turned it
off as a jest, or refused pointblank
to answer.</p>

<p>And then they had beautiful white
flowers, which they lifted high in the
air, like parasols, whereas the real
branches, that grew on the stubs,
never got to look like anything but
overgrown children and could put
forth neither flowers nor fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>&#8220;Why, here&#8217;s quite a wood!&#8221; said
the mouse, one evening, sitting under
the foliage and peeping up with her
bright eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are the wood,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray take a look round,&#8221; said the
parsley. &#8220;If you like us, build your
nest in us. All that we can offer you
is at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe them,&#8221; said the real
bushes. &#8220;They only make a show
while summer lasts. When autumn
comes, they are gone without leaving
a trace behind them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about autumn,&#8221;
said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in autumn,&#8221; said
the goat&#8217;s-foot. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cock-and-bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
story with which they take in the
baby bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Autumn exists all right,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;And after that comes winter.
Then the thing is to have one&#8217;s
larder full. It&#8217;s well I thought of it.
I think I will dig myself a little hole
between the stones and begin laying
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him burrow in the ground that
pleases,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have loftier aims,&#8221; said the
goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>Then they stood a bit and said nothing.
And then the parsley sighed
and said what they were both thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only a bird would come and
build her nest in us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would shade it and rock it and
take such care of it that the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
bushes would die of envy,&#8221; said the
goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you have me?&#8221; asked a
voice.</p>

<p>A queer, gray individual came walking
up the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the spider,&#8221; said the individual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you fly?&#8221; asked the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do a little of everything, if
need be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you eat flies?&#8221; asked the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;All day long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you lay eggs?&#8221; asked the
goat&#8217;s-foot. &#8220;For, of course, you&#8217;re
a woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;thank goodness!&#8221; said the
spider.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re the bird for us,&#8221; said
the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re heartily welcome,&#8221; said
the goat&#8217;s-foot. &#8220;You look pretty
light, so you won&#8217;t break our
branches. Be sure and begin to
build as soon as you please. You&#8217;ll
find plenty of materials in the
hedge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter in the least if you
nip off a leaf here and there,&#8221; said
the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, I carry my own materials
with me,&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any luggage,&#8221; said the
goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your husband&#8217;s bringing
it?&#8221; asked the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no husband, thank goodness!&#8221;
said the spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing!&#8221; said the mouse, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sat listening. &#8220;That must be awfully
sad for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there&#8217;s the usual feminine
balderdash!&#8221; said the spider. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what makes us women such ridiculous
and contemptible creatures. It&#8217;s
always &#8216;my husband&#8217; here and &#8216;my
husband&#8217; there. I should like to know
what use a husband is to one, when
all&#8217;s said. He&#8217;s nothing but a nuisance
and a worry. If ever I take another,
he sha&#8217;n&#8217;t live with me, whatever
happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you talk!&#8221; said the mouse.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything more dismal
than if my husband were to live
away from me. And I should like to
know how I should manage with the
children, if he didn&#8217;t help me, the
dear soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221; replied the spider. &#8220;Fiddle-de-dee!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I don&#8217;t see the use of all
that coddling. Lay your eggs in a
sensible place and then leave them
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t talk like a bird,&#8221; said
the parsley, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I too am beginning to be uneasy
about her,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can call me what you like,&#8221;
said the spider. &#8220;In any case, I don&#8217;t
associate with the other birds. If there
are too many of them here, I won&#8217;t
even stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord preserve us!&#8221; said the parsley,
who began to fear lest she should
go away. &#8220;There are hardly ever any
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They flew into the wood when the
trees were cut down,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s dull here,&#8221; said the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
twigs on the stubs. &#8220;One never hears
a note.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right here,&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;As long as the flies buzz, I&#8217;m
content.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot
and the parsley, straightening themselves.</p>

<p>The spider crawled about and looked
around her and the mouse kept on
following her with her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But
why do you build a nest when you
leave your eggs to shift for themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Mousie,&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;You may as well look upon me
from the start as an independent
woman. I think only of myself and
my belongings and I look after myself.
If I ever condescend to take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
husband, the milksop will have to look
after himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how you speak of him!&#8221; said
the mouse. &#8220;My husband is bigger
and stronger than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never met him,&#8221; replied the
spider, carelessly. &#8220;The men in my
family are scarce a quarter as large
as I am. Wretched creatures, not
worth a fly. I should be ashamed to
share my flat with a customer like
one of those. But now I&#8217;m going to
build.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better wait till it&#8217;s light,&#8221;
said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you build with?&#8221; asked
the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the dark, as it happens,&#8221; said
the spider. &#8220;And I carry my own
building-materials.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she scrambled to the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the goat&#8217;s-foot and looked round the
landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have good eyes to see at
night,&#8221; said the mouse. &#8220;Mine are
not bad, but still I shouldn&#8217;t care to
build a nest by this light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for eyes, I have eight,&#8221; said the
spider. &#8220;And they see what they have
to. I have also eight legs, I may as
well tell you, and you needn&#8217;t be
struck with amazement on that account.
Taken all round, I am a
woman who knows how to help herself
in an emergency. There&#8217;s no coddling
here and no nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now she pressed her abdomen
against the branch of the goat&#8217;s-foot
on which she was sitting and then
took a header into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll break her neck!&#8221; cried the
mouse, terrified.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got a neck,&#8221; said the spider,
from down below. &#8220;And, if I
had, I wouldn&#8217;t break it. You go
home to your dear husband and fondle
him. When you come back in the
morning, you shall see what a capable
woman can do who doesn&#8217;t waste
her time on love and emotions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mouse went away, because she
had other things to see to and also
because the spider&#8217;s words hurt her.
But the goat&#8217;s-foot and the fool&#8217;s-parsley
were obliged to remain where
they were and so were the long twigs
on the stubs. And the spider behaved
in such a curious manner that none
of them closed an eye all night for
looking at her.</p>

<p>The fact is, she did nothing but take
headers into the air. She jumped first
from one branch and then from another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
then crawled up again and
jumped once more. And, although
she had no wings, as any one could
see, she let herself down quite slowly
to the ground or to another branch,
never missed her jump and did not
come to the least harm. To and fro,
up and down she went, the whole
night long.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a bird,&#8221; said the parsley, delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.
&#8220;What else could it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the twigs on the stubs bobbed
at one another mockingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never been a bird in her life,&#8221;
they said. &#8220;Can she sing? Have you
heard as much as a chirp from her?&#8221;</p>

<p>The goat&#8217;s-foot and the parsley
looked at each other doubtfully. And,
when the spider sat still, for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
catching her breath, the parsley
ventured upon a question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; replied the spider. &#8220;Do
you think I go in for that sort of
twaddle? What is there to sing about?
Life is nothing but toil and drudgery
and, if a lone woman is to hold
her own, she must turn to and set to
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Birds sing,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;They sing because they are in
love,&#8221; said the spider. &#8220;I am not in
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till the right man comes
along,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does, he&#8217;d better look out,&#8221;
said the spider.</p>

<p>Then she took another header; and
so she went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But, when the day began to break,
the goat&#8217;s-foot and the parsley were
near snapping with surprise.</p>

<p>The spider was hanging in the air
between their branches. She had
drawn her legs up under her, bundled
herself together and was sleeping
like a top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she on you?&#8221; asked the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the parsley. &#8220;Is she
on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not on us either,&#8221; said the
twigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a bird,&#8221; said the parsley and
the goat&#8217;s-foot, enraptured.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bird doesn&#8217;t hang in the middle
of the air, sleeping,&#8221; said the twigs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s an elf,&#8221; said the mouse, who
came up at that moment. &#8220;Just wait
till it&#8217;s quite light: then perhaps we
shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, when the sun rose, they saw.</p>

<p>In between the branches of the
goat&#8217;s-foot and the fool&#8217;s-parsley
were stretched a number of very fine
threads, which crossed one another
and shone in the sun so that it was a
delight to see. Other threads ran
across them in circles, one outside the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the mouse. &#8220;Now I understand.
She was sitting in the middle
of that. But where has she gone
to now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; said the spider, from
under a leaf. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand the
bright sunlight. What do you think
of my work? But I haven&#8217;t finished
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&#8220;Pish!&#8221; said the mouse. &#8220;Frankly
speaking, I think it&#8217;s a funny sort of
nest you&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nest, nest, nest!&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;It&#8217;s you who&#8217;ve been talking of a
nest, not I. You keep on taking it
for granted that I am a silly, effeminate
woman like yourself and the
others. What use is a nest to me? I&#8217;m
all right here under this leaf. It&#8217;s
shady here and good enough for me.
The threads are my web. I catch flies
in it. I wonder, shall we have a little
rain? Then I can set to again and
finish my work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently, the sun disappeared behind
the clouds. A mild and gentle
rain fell and when it stopped the
spider came out and stretched her
eight legs contentedly in the moist
air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>And then she set to work.</p>

<p>They all saw how she pulled a multitude
of very fine threads at a time
from her abdomen. Then she began
to unravel them with combs which
she had at the ends of her legs, twisted
them together into one thick
thread and hung it beside the others
where she thought that the opening
was too large or the net not strong
enough. All the threads were greasy
and sticky, so that the flies would
have to hang fast in them. Later in
the day, the web was ready; and they
all admired it because it was so
pretty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m settled,&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>At that moment came a starling
and sat on the top of one of the long
twigs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nothing to eat here?&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
asked. &#8220;A few grubs? A spider or
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The goat&#8217;s-foot and the parsley said
nothing: they almost withered with
fright at the idea of losing their
lodger. The mouse made off, for
safety&#8217;s sake, but the twigs on the
stubs cried with one breath that a
nice fat spider had just come and
had spun her web in the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see none,&#8221; said the starling
and flew away.</p>

<p>But the spider, quick as lightning,
had let herself down to the ground
by a long thread and lay there as still
as if she were dead. Now she crept
up again and sat in the middle of
her web with all her eight legs outstretched.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a near thing,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Now my turn&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Up came a smart little fly, who
didn&#8217;t see the web but flew in and
got caught, poor fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an earnest,&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>She bit the fly with her mandibles,
which were filled with poison, so that
he died at once. Then she ate him.
And she did the same with the next
three that came into the web. After
that, she could eat no more. She let
a good many little insects, that had
the misfortune to get caught, hang
and sprawl, without stirring a limb.
When a good fat fly came along,
she bit him dead, spun a little web
round him and hung him up:</p>

<p>&#8220;He may come in handy one day,
when I run short,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very sensible,&#8221; said the mouse.
&#8220;That&#8217;s really the first thing you&#8217;ve
said that I can agree with. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
otherwise, I am bound to say I don&#8217;t
care for your ways. They&#8217;re far too
sly for me. And then you use poison,
like the adder. That, I think, is
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so, do you?&#8221; said the
spider, with a sneer. &#8220;Is it any worse
than what you others do? I suppose
you blow a trumpet when you sneak
out after your prey; eh, you pious
little mouse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I could, if I had a trumpet,&#8221;
said the mouse. &#8220;Thank goodness,
I am not a robber and murderer
like yourself. I gather nuts and
acorns and anything else that comes
to hand and I have never hurt a
soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re a dear little woman of
the old-fashioned sort,&#8221; said the spider,
&#8220;You take other people&#8217;s leavings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and are quite happy. Then you
go home and let your husband and
children pet and fondle you. I&#8217;m not
built that way, let me tell you. I
don&#8217;t care for caresses, but I have an
appetite. I want meat: nice, juicy
fly-meat; and lots of it. I ask nothing
of anybody, but get myself
what I want. If things go well, I
have all the honour and pleasure myself;
if they go badly, I don&#8217;t go crying
to anybody. It would be a good
thing if there were more women like
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so rough,&#8221; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks!&#8221; replied the spider.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all one. I&#8217;m no worse than most
people. Take the goat&#8217;s-foot and the
parsley: they fight for the butterflies
and bees and steal each other&#8217;s light
and air as much as they can.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;An exceedingly sensible woman,&#8221;
said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s such an ugly name of
yours,&#8221; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help that,&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;Some people call me venom-head,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
because of those few drops of poison
I carry in my mandibles. They&#8217;re so
immensely upset about the poor flies
I catch; and they kill a fly themselves
if he only settles on their nose. It&#8217;s
six of one and half a dozen of the
other. Nothing but sentimental affectation.
Besides, I have no objection
to changing my name. You can
call me <i>spinner</i>, if you prefer. That&#8217;s
a word which a dainty little lady like
you can pronounce without fainting;
and it suits me, because there&#8217;s not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
animal in the world that spins as
beautifully as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very likely,&#8221; said the
mouse, shaking her head. &#8220;But what
you do is ugly and you yourself are
so hideous that there&#8217;s no excusing
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; asked the spider and
laughed. &#8220;Look here, little Mrs.
Mouse: I&#8217;m rationally dressed. My
homely gray clothes suit my work
and don&#8217;t attract unnecessary attention.
Thank goodness, I don&#8217;t have
to dress up like the others, who deck
themselves out to obtain love and
happiness and who strut and swagger
in a way that a sensible person
would be ashamed of. But,
of course, the ninnies despise me
for my plain frocks. Let them!
What do I care for ninnies? And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
if they come into my meshes, I&#8217;ll
eat them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mouse shook her head and went
away. The parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot
muttered softly to each other.
The spider hung in her net, stretched
her legs and digested her food.</p>

<p>When the sun came out, she crept
under her leaf and then the mouse
came back and peeped up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she asleep?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said the parsley. &#8220;And
you had better not wake her with
your chattering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s our bird, once and for all,&#8221;
said the goat&#8217;s-foot. &#8220;Though she
may behave differently from other
birds, she has done us the honour and
shown us the confidence to build in
us and therefore we ask that she may
be respected.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;A nice sort of bird!&#8221; said the twigs,
with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case, she&#8217;s better than nothing,&#8221;
said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such louts as you had better hold
your tongues,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.
&#8220;No one builds in you, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not a bird,&#8221; said the mouse.
&#8220;But that&#8217;s no reason why she
shouldn&#8217;t be very good. Now <i>I</i> think
that she&#8217;s a poor, unhappy old maid,
who has fallen out with existence.
Perhaps her sweetheart jilted her;
that leaves a wound. My first husband
ran away with a white mouse,
just after my children were born. So
I speak from experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s possible,&#8221; said the parsley,
thoughtfully. &#8220;But what can one do
in a case like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must try and make her happy,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
said the mouse. &#8220;If she goes on
leading this lonely life, she will grow
more bitter every day and at last all
gentler feelings will be stifled in her.
If we could only find a husband
for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if we only could!&#8221; said the
parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then perhaps she would build a
real nest, with little eggs in it,&#8221; said
the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she would sing to her
young,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would at once entitle us to
rank with the bushes,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;
asked the spider, putting out her
head from under the leaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about you,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;We were saying that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
really ought to get married. It&#8217;s not
good, in the long run, for a woman
to live alone. It makes her queer and
sour. If you only knew how delightful
it is to see one&#8217;s dear little young
and feed them and educate them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the provision of nature,&#8221; said
the mouse. &#8220;And I will do what I
can for you, no matter what you say.
I see a heap of spiders daily on my
way along the hedge. They are certainly
much smaller than you, but
nice fellows, for all that. Perhaps I
may meet a big one, too. Then I
shall tell him that there&#8217;s a charming
young lady over here, longing for a
sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll be telling an awful
lie,&#8221; said the spider. &#8220;And you needn&#8217;t
look for one who is bigger than I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for our men are all miserable under-sized
vermin. I tell you, no one looks
upon them as worth a straw. It&#8217;s long
been understood among us that it&#8217;s
only the women that are good for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said the mouse.
&#8220;I shall find the right man yet. And
I feel sure that you&#8217;ll be much more
amiable when you&#8217;re in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away, Mousie,&#8221; said the spider.
&#8220;The man who can please me
isn&#8217;t born yet. But you have nothing
in your head but love and nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>She killed a fly, spun a web round
him and hung him up and then hid
under the leaf. The mouse went
away, the parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot
put their heads together and
talked of the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The next morning, a really nice
gentleman-spider was sitting on the
parsley, but a good way off from the
snappish young lady.</p>

<p>He had brushed his clothes and
spun a couple of fine threads to show
what he could do. He bent and
stretched his legs for her to see
that he was well-shaped. Seven of his
eyes beamed with love, while the
eighth took care that she didn&#8217;t eat
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me, miss, to offer you my
hand and heart,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fair-spoken man,&#8221; said the
parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;A charming man,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I that sent him here,&#8221; said
the mouse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; said the damsel.</p>

<p>But the spider did not throw up the
game so easily. He gracefully bowed
his thorax, set two of his eyes to
watch that nothing happened to him
and looked doubly enamoured with
the other six:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not think that I mean to be a
burden to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have my
own web a little way down the hedge
and I can easily catch the few flies I
require. I have even got five real fat
ones hanging and spun up, which I
shall esteem it an honour to offer you
to-morrow, so that you may see that
it is love alone that urges me to propose
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you talking your nonsense?&#8221;
said the damsel. &#8220;What the
blazes should I do with such a silly
man?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; he said&mdash;and now there
was only one eye in love, so fierce was
her air&mdash;&#8220;If my courtship seems inopportune
to you, I will retire at
once and wait till another time....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather think that&#8217;s the wisest
thing you could do,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Clear
out, this minute, or I&#8217;ll....&#8221;</p>

<p>He slid down a thread in no time
and she after him. But he escaped
and, a little later, she was sitting in
her web again, looking sourer than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a woman!&#8221; said the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just so!&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do to take the first that
comes,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only that he wasn&#8217;t the right
one,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>But the unfortunate suitor went
round the hedge telling the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
spiders about the charming and remarkable
lady whose web hung between
the parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is <i>so</i> big,&#8221; he said, spreading
his legs as wide as he could. &#8220;I have
never seen any one so pretty in my
life. But she&#8217;s as proud as a peacock.
I shall certainly die of grief at her
refusal. In any case, one thing is
sure, that I shall never marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened to him wide-eyed and
made him tell them again. It was not
long before the story of the proud
and beautiful spider-princess went
the round of the hedge. As soon as
the men had finished their day&#8217;s
work, they came together and sat and
talked about her. Each of them had
his own observations to make, but
gradually they were all so excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with love that they thought they simply
could not live unless they won
the fair one.</p>

<p>One after the other, they set out
a-wooing and they all fared badly.</p>

<p>The first was a dashing fellow, who
had chaffed the unfortunate suitor
mercilessly for promising her the five
flies which he had got spun up at
home in his web:</p>

<p>&#8220;Women don&#8217;t care a hang for
promises,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They like their
presents down, then and there. You
just watch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came dragging a splendid blue-bottle
along and laid it without a
word at the damsel&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would allow a man
to support me?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Before he could look round, she had
caught him and eaten him up. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
scornfully let the fly be, but, later in
the afternoon, when she thought no
one saw her, she came down notwithstanding
and ate it.</p>

<p>And the wooers that came after
fared not a whit better.</p>

<p>She ate six of them in the middle
of their speech and two had not even
time to open their mouths. One was
caught by the starling, just as he was
about to make his bow, and one fell
into the ditch with fright, when she
looked at him, and was drowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes twelve,&#8221; said the
mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not counted them,&#8221; said the
spider. &#8220;But now I presume they&#8217;ll
leave me in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a terrible woman,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;I prophesy you&#8217;ll end by
going childless to your grave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>For the first time, the spider seemed
a little pensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now her hard heart is melting,&#8221;
said the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the wild parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>But she continued to look pensive
and stared at her combs and never
noticed that a fly flew into her web.
Presently, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, one ought at least to
see that one brings a pair of strapping
wenches into the world. I suppose
it&#8217;s my duty to leave somebody
behind me to inherit my contempt
for those wretched men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on the road!&#8221; whispered the
mouse.</p>

<p>And the goat&#8217;s-foot and the fool&#8217;s-parsley
nodded and neither of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
said a word, so as not to disturb her
in her reflections.</p>

<p>But the mouse hurried off to the
hedge and called all the surviving
gentleman-spiders together:</p>

<p>&#8220;The one who proposes to the princess
to-morrow gets her,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;She&#8217;s quite altered. She&#8217;s melted.
Her heart is like wax. She won&#8217;t
catch any flies, won&#8217;t eat, won&#8217;t drink
and just sits and stares wistfully before
her. Look sharp!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mouse ran away.</p>

<p>But the spiders looked at one another
doubtfully. Not one of them
had the proper courage to risk the
attempt, seeing how badly the twelve
had fared, and a few even of the
wiser ones went up at once and hid
under their leaves, so as not to fall
into temptation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>A few remained behind, who
thought about what the mouse had
said, including one little young, thin
one, who had always listened while
the others were talking about the
wonderful princess, but had never
said anything himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; cried all the others, in one
breath.</p>

<p>And they began to laugh at the
thought that this chap should achieve
what so many a bold spider-fellow
had lost his life in attempting.</p>

<p>But the little chap let them laugh
as much as they pleased:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;m poaching on
your preserves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
none of you that has the pluck. And
I just feel like making the experiment.
I&#8217;ve been there to look at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and, by Jove, she is a fine woman!
If she&#8217;s rejected the twelve, perhaps
she&#8217;ll accept the thirteenth. Also, I
think the suitors went the wrong way
to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you think so, do you?&#8221; said
the others, still laughing. &#8220;And how
will you go to work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can come with me and see for
yourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stroll across
to-morrow and propose.&#8221;</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>And he did, the next morning.</p>

<p>He came crawling up on his eight
legs, very sedately and circumspectly.
A little behind him came all that was
left in the way of man-spiders in the
hedge. The long twigs on the stubs
stretched out their necks to see him.
The parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
spread out both flowers and leaves,
to make his road as easy as possible.
The mouse stood on her hind-legs
with curiosity and stared and listened.</p>

<p>The princess herself sat in her web
and pretended not to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noble princess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
come to ask you if you will have me
for your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the thirteenth,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But within herself she thought that
she liked him better than the others.
They had all wanted to take her for
their wife: this one begged her to
take him for her husband. That
sounded modest and well-mannered.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s giving way,&#8221; said the mouse
and danced with rapture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t eaten him yet!&#8221; whispered
the gentleman-spiders to one
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I well know,&#8221; said the wooer, &#8220;how
presumptuous it is of me to address
such a request to you. What is a
wretched man compared with a woman
and, in particular, what is a silly
fellow like myself to you, who are
the largest and cleverest lady in all
the hedge? But that is just what attracts
me to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him. He
nearly fell to the ground with fright
and cast his eight eyes down before
him. All the other gentleman-spiders
rushed away at a furious pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she&#8217;ll eat him,&#8221; said the
goat&#8217;s-foot and the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a sweet young thing!&#8221; said
the twigs on the stubs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;She&#8217;s a terrible woman!&#8221; said the
mouse.</p>

<p>But she did not eat him.</p>

<p>She caught a fly that flew into her
web just then and began leisurely
to devour it, while attentively contemplating
her suitor.</p>

<p>He was an ugly little beggar, especially
now, when he was shaking
all over his body, because he thought
that his last hour had struck. But
that was just how she liked to see
him. She thought that quite the right
attitude for a man. And, when he
saw that she gave no sign of making
for him, he recovered to such an extent
that he was able to finish his
speech:</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite understand that you can&#8217;t
see anything at all good-looking in
me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
myself out better than I am; and I
am only a miserable man. But, if I
could become the father of a daughter
who was like you, I should consider
that I had attained the object
of my life and give thanks most
humbly for my good fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a wonderful thing came to
pass. She took the leg of a fly and
threw it to him, which among spiders
means the same as &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quivering with happiness and apprehension,
he crept nearer to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I accept
you. But mind you don&#8217;t irritate me.
For then I&#8217;ll eat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s accepted him!&#8221; said the
mouse and swooned away with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s accepted him!&#8221; said the
goat&#8217;s-foot and the parsley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;She&#8217;s accepted him!&#8221; said the twigs
on the stubs and rustled for sheer
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s accepted him!&#8221; cried the gentleman-spiders,
who had come back,
but now ran away again, partly to
spread the news in the hedge and
partly so as not to be eaten at the
wedding.</p>

<p>And it <i>was</i> a wedding.</p>

<p>The whole hedge was a scene of
jubilation and the mouse was the
gladdest of them all, for it was her
doing. Or perhaps the fool&#8217;s-parsley
and the goat&#8217;s-foot were gladder still,
for they would now have that family-life
in their tops which they
had so often longed for and which
would raise them to the level of the
real bushes. As for the twigs on the
old stubs, they were infected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the universal joy and forgot their
envy.</p>

<p>The wedding took place forthwith,
for there was nothing to wait for.
The parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot scattered
their white flowers on every
side to mark the festival. The mouse
dragged her little ones up the hedge
so that they might see the happy
bridal pair; the bluebell rang, the
poppy laughed and the bindweed
closed her petals half an hour earlier
than usual so as not to embarrass the
newly-married couple with a misplaced
curiosity.</p>

<p>The bride ate all the flies that she
had spun up, without offering the
bridegroom one. But that did not
matter, for he was up to the throat
in happiness, so he could not have
got a morsel down in any case. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
made himself as small as possible.
Once, when she stroked him on the
back with one of her combs, he shook
till they thought that he would die.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>The mouse was astir early next
morning:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen nothing of the
young couple?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re asleep,&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the mouse. &#8220;What a
good thing that we got her married
at last. Now you&#8217;ll see how sweet
and amiable she will become. There
is no end to the wonders that love
can work. And when the children
come!...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she&#8217;ll sing then?&#8221;
asked the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&#8220;I shall hope for the best,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;She does not look as if she
had a voice, but, as I said&mdash;love!
Now you&#8217;ll just see, when she comes,
what a radiance there will be about
her. I half doubt if we shall know
her when we see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the mouse laughed and the
parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot laughed
and the sun rose and laughed with
the rest.</p>

<p>Then the spider came crawling
from under her leafy hiding-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck! Good luck!&#8221; squeaked
the mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck! Good luck!&#8221; said the
parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot.</p>

<p>The spider stretched herself and
yawned. Then she went off and sat
in her web, as though nothing had
happened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the husband?&#8221; asked the
mouse. &#8220;Won&#8217;t he get out of bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve eaten him this morning,&#8221; replied
the spider.</p>

<p>The mouse gave a scream that was
heard all over the hedge. The parsley
and the goat&#8217;s-foot trembled so that
all their flowers fell off. The twigs
snapped as though a storm were raging.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looked so stupid and ugly as
he sat there beside me,&#8221; said the spider;
&#8220;so I ate him. He could have
staid away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven preserve us all!&#8221; screamed
the mouse. &#8220;To eat one&#8217;s own, lawful
husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, oh dear!&#8221; said the goat&#8217;s-foot
and the parsley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>That day was very quiet in the
hedge and the next was no livelier.</p>

<p>The spider attended to her web and
caught and ate more flies than ever.
She did not speak a word and looked
so fierce that no one dared speak a
word to her. The gentleman-spiders
took good care not to come near her.
They met every evening and talked
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he <i>got</i> her all the same!&#8221;
said the most romantic of them.</p>

<p>Then the others fell upon him and
asked him if he thought that that
was happiness, to be eaten by one&#8217;s
wife on the morning after the wedding.
And he didn&#8217;t know what to
answer, for his romance wasn&#8217;t so
very real, after all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The mouse stole away dejectedly
and went to her hole. She took the
thing to heart as though it had happened
in her own family. The goat&#8217;s-foot
and the parsley hung their
screens and felt sheepish and ashamed
in the face of the twigs on the stubs.
And so great was their overthrow
that even the twigs thought it would
be a shame to scoff at them.</p>

<p>But, one day, when there was a blazing
sun and the spider had crawled
as far as she could into the shade of
the leaf, the parsley bent down to
the mouse&#8217;s hole and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Psst!... Mousie!...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the mouse and
came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the goat&#8217;s-foot and I who
have something to ask you,&#8221; said the
parsley. &#8220;Tell me&mdash;you&#8217;re so clever&mdash;don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
you believe that it&#8217;s possible
that the spider may become a different
person when she begins to lay
her eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe nothing now,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;I shall never believe that
that woman will ever lay eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she did, for all that.</p>

<p>One fine morning, she began and
behaved in such a way that no one in
the hedge ever forgot the story:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;That one should
be bothered with this nonsense with
children now!&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid a heap of ten eggs and
stood looking at them, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Build a nest for your eggs,&#8221; said
the parsley. &#8220;All that we have and
possess is at your disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit on them and hatch them,&#8221; said
the goat&#8217;s-foot. &#8220;We will weave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
roof over you, so the sun won&#8217;t inconvenience
you in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lay up some small flies for the
children, for when they come out,&#8221;
said the mouse. &#8220;You have no idea
what those young ones can eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practise singing to them a bit,&#8221;
said the twigs on the stubs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; said the spider.</p>

<p>She laid four more heaps. Then she
began to spin a fine, close covering
of white threads to wrap each heap
in separately.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not quite heartless,&#8221; said the
mouse.</p>

<p>The spider took a heap, went down
the hedge and buried it in the
ground. Then up again for the next
heap and so on until all the five
heaps were buried.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
done with! And they won&#8217;t catch me
at it again. Now at least I am a free
and independent woman once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice woman!&#8221; said the mouse.
&#8220;A shame and a disgrace to her sex,
that&#8217;s what she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a dear little bird!&#8221; said the
twigs on the stubs, sarcastically.</p>

<p>But the parsley and the goat&#8217;s-foot
said nothing.</p>

<p>The next morning the spider was
gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The starling caught her,&#8221; said the
mouse. &#8220;She was gone in a twinkling.
I saw it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only she doesn&#8217;t make him ill,&#8221;
said the twigs. &#8220;She must have been
a bad mouthful.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then autumn came and winter.</p>

<p>The mouse sat snug in her hole and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the spider&#8217;s eggs lay snug in the
ground. The goat&#8217;s-foot and the
parsley withered and died. The
twigs on the stubs lost their leaves,
but rustled on through storm and
frost and snow until next spring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MIST</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span><small>HE</small> sun had just set.</p>

<p>The frog was croaking his even-song,
which took so long that there
seemed to be no end to it. The bee
crept into her hive and the little children
cried because it was bed-time.
The flowers closed their petals and
bent their heads, the bird hid his beak
under his wing and the stag lay down
to rest in the tall, soft grass of the
glade.</p>

<p>The bells of the village-church rang
in the night and, when that was
done, the old sexton went off home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
chatted a little with the villagers who
were taking their evening stroll or
standing at their doors smoking a
pipe, bade them good-night and shut
his door.</p>

<p>By and by, it was quite still and
darkness fell. There was still a light
in the parsonage and at the doctor&#8217;s.
But at the farm-houses it was dark,
for the farmers rise early in the summer
and therefore have to go early
to bed.</p>

<p>Then the stars shone forth in the
sky and the moon rose higher and
higher. A dog barked down in the
village. But he was certainly dreaming,
for there was really nothing to
bark at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>&#8220;Is any one here?&#8221; asked the mist.</p>

<p>But no one answered, for there was
no one there.</p>

<p>So the mist went on in his light,
gleaming clothes. He danced over
the meadows, up and down, to and
fro. Now he would lie quite still for
a while and then begin to dance
again. He skipped across the pond
and into the wood, where he flung his
long, wet arms round the trunks of
the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, friend?&#8221; asked the
night-scented rocket, who stood and
distilled her perfume for her own
pleasure.</p>

<p>The mist did not reply, but went on
dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked who you were,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
rocket. &#8220;And, as you don&#8217;t answer
me, I conclude that you are an ill-mannered
churl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll conclude you!&#8221; said the mist.</p>

<p>And he lay down round the night-scented
rocket, till her petals were
dripping wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Hi!&#8221; screamed the rocket.
&#8220;Keep your fingers to yourself, my
friend! I feel as if I had been dipped
in the pond. You needn&#8217;t be so angry,
just because I ask you who you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist rose up again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who I am?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Why,
you wouldn&#8217;t understand if I told
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try,&#8221; said the rocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the dew-drop on the flowers,
the cloud in the sky and the mist on
the fields,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon?&#8221; said the rocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
&#8220;Would you mind saying that
again? Why, I know the dew-drop.
He settles on my petals every morning;
and I don&#8217;t see any resemblance
between you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I am the dew-drop, for all
that!&#8221; said the mist, sadly. &#8220;But nobody
knows me. I have to spend my
life in many shapes. Sometimes I am
dew and sometimes I am rain and
sometimes I trickle in the form of a
clear, cool spring through the wood.
But, when I dance over the meadow
in the evening, then people say that
the mist is rising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer story,&#8221; said the
rocket. &#8220;Have you any more to tell
me? The night is long and sometimes
I feel a little bored.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sad story,&#8221; answered the
mist. &#8220;But you shall hear it if you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>And he made as though to lie down,
but the night-scented rocket shook all
her petals in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be so good and keep a little farther
off,&#8221; she said, &#8220;at least, until
you have introduced yourself properly.
I have never cared to be intimate
with people whom I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist lay down a few steps away
and began his story:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born deep down in the
ground,&#8221; he said, &#8220;much deeper than
your roots grow. I and my brothers&mdash;for
you must know that we are a
big family&mdash;came into the world in
the shape of clear crystal spring-water
and lay long in our hiding-place.
But, one day, we sprang suddenly
from under a gentle hill, into the
midst of the full, bright sunshine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Believe me, it was delightful to run
through the wood. We rippled over
the stones and splashed against the
banks. Dear little fishes played
among us and the trees bent over us
and reflected their green splendour.
If a leaf fell, we rocked it and caressed
it and bore it into the wide
world. Oh, how delightful it was! It
was really the happiest time in my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I soon hear how you came to
be mist?&#8221; asked the night-scented
rocket, impatiently. &#8220;I know the
brook. On a very still night, I can
hear her babbling from where I
stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist rose and took a little
dance across the meadow. Then he
came back and continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;That is the worst of this world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
we are never satisfied with what we
have. For instance, we ran on and on
until, at last, we came to a big lake,
where the water-lilies rocked on the
water and the dragon-flies buzzed
around on their great stiff wings. On
the surface, the water was as clear as
a mirror; but, whether we wanted
to or not, we had to run along the
bottom and there it was dark and
dismal. I could not bear it. I longed
for the sunbeams. I knew them so
well from the time when I ran in the
brook. Now they looked down upon
us through the leaves and cast a
bright light over me. I wanted to see
them again and therefore I crept up
to the surface and lay down in the
sunshine among the white water-lilies
and their big green leaves. But
oh, how the sun burnt upon the lake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
It was almost unendurable and I
bitterly regretted that I had not
remained at the bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is very dull,&#8221; said the rocket.
&#8220;When are we coming to the
mist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is!&#8221; said the mist and lay
down around the flower, who almost
lost her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! Hi!&#8221; screamed the rocket.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the roughest playfellow I
know. Go away and tell your story
in your own manner, if you must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the evening, when the sun had
gone down, I suddenly became wonderfully
light,&#8221; said the mist. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how it happened, but I
felt that I must rise up and fly away
from the lake. And, in fact, before I
knew it, I was hovering over the water,
away from the dragon-flies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the water-lilies. The evening-wind
carried me along; I flew high in the
air and there I met many of my
brothers, who had been as inquisitive
as I and had met with the same fortune.
We were wafted up to the sky;
we had turned into clouds: do you
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not quite sure,&#8221; said the rocket.
&#8220;It does not sound very probable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s true, for all that,&#8221; said
the mist. &#8220;Now listen. The wind carried
us for some time through the
sky. Then, suddenly, he grew tired
of us and let us go. And we fell down
upon the earth in pouring rain. The
flowers lost no time in closing their
petals and the birds took shelter, all
except the ducks and geese, who were
the better pleased the wetter it was.
Oh; and the farmer, too: he stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
there rejoicing, because his crops
needed rain. He did not care how
wet he got. But, otherwise, we really
caused a great disturbance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so you&#8217;re the rain too, are
you?&#8221; asked the night-scented rocket.
&#8220;I say, you seem to have plenty to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I never have any rest,&#8221; said
the mist.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same, I haven&#8217;t yet heard
how you became mist,&#8221; said the rocket.
&#8220;Now don&#8217;t fly into a passion
again: you promised to tell me and
I would rather hear the whole story
over again than once more shiver in
your horrid damp arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist lay and wept for a moment
and then continued:</p>



<p>&#8220;When I had fallen on the ground
as rain, I sank through the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
earth and was glad to think I was
returning to my native place, the
deep subterranean source. There at
least I had known peace and been
free from cares. But, just as I was
sinking, the roots of the trees sucked
me up again and, all day long, I had
to wander around in the branches
and leaves. They used me as a beast
of burden, you see. I had to drag up
from the roots all the food that the
leaves and flowers needed. I was not
free until the evening. When the sun
had gone down, all the trees and
flowers heaved deep sighs and in their
sighs my brothers and I were sent
forth as a light, gleaming mist. At
night, we dance over the fields. But,
in the morning, when the sun rises,
we turn into beautiful, clear dew-drops
and come and hang on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
petals. Then you shake us off and we
sink deeper and deeper until we come
to the source where we were born,
unless some root or other snatches
us up on the way. And so it goes
on: through the brook, into the lake,
up in the sky and back again to
earth....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried the night-scented
rocket. &#8220;It makes my head swim to
listen to you!&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Now the frog began to stir. He
stretched his legs and went down to
the ditch to take his morning bath.
The birds began to chirp in the
wood and the stag belled among
the trees.</p>

<p>Morning began to break and the
sun peeped over the hill:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What does
it all mean? One can&#8217;t see one&#8217;s hand
before one&#8217;s eyes. Morning-wind!
Up with you, you sluggard, and
blow that nasty mist away!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the morning-wind flew across
the fields and blew away the mist. At
the same moment, the sun sent his
first rays straight down upon the
night-scented rocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said the flower. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
the sun! Now I must be quick
and close my petals. Where in the
name of wonder has the mist gone
to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; said the dew-drop
hanging from her stalk.</p>

<p>But the night-scented rocket shook
her head fretfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell that to the children,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word of all you&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
said. You&#8217;re just water and nothing
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right enough there!&#8221; said
the sun. And he laughed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ANEMONES</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">&#8220;P</span><small>EEWIT</small>! Peewit!&#8221; cried the lapwing,
as he flew over the moss in the
wood. &#8220;Dame Spring is coming! I
can feel it in my legs and wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the new grass, which lay
down below in the earth, heard this,
it at once began to sprout and peeped
out gaily between the old, yellow
straw. For the grass is always in an
immense hurry.</p>

<p>Now the anemones in between the
trees had also heard the lapwing&#8217;s
cry, but refused on any account to
appear above the earth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t believe the lapwing,&#8221;
they whispered to one another. &#8220;He
is a flighty customer, whom one can&#8217;t
trust. He always comes too early and
starts calling at once. No, we will
wait quite quietly till the starling
and the swallow come. They are sensible,
sober people, who are not to
be taken in and who know what they
are about.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the starlings came.</p>

<p>They sat down on a twig outside
their summer villa and looked about
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too early, as usual,&#8221; said Mr.
Starling. &#8220;Not a green leaf and not
a fly, except an old tough one of last
year, not worth opening one&#8217;s beak
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Starling said nothing, but
looked none too cheerful either.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&#8220;If we had only remained in our
snug winter-quarters beyond the
mountains!&#8221; said Mr. Starling. He
was angry because his wife did not
answer, for he was so cold that he
thought a little discussion might do
him good. &#8220;But it&#8217;s <i>your</i> fault, just
as last year. You&#8217;re always in such
a terrible hurry to go to the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m in a hurry, I know the
reason <i>why</i>,&#8221; said Mrs. Starling.
&#8220;And it would be a shame for you if
you didn&#8217;t know too, for they are
your eggs as well as mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven forbid!&#8221; replied Mr. Starling,
indignantly. &#8220;When have I denied
my family? Perhaps you expect
me, over and above, to sing to you in
the cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>that</i> I do!&#8221; said Mrs. Starling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in the tone which he could not
resist.</p>

<p>He at once began to whistle as best
he could. But, when Mrs. Starling
had heard the first notes, she flapped
her wings and pecked at him with
her beak:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be quiet at once!&#8221; she
screamed, angrily. &#8220;That sounds so
dismal that it makes one quite melancholy.
You&#8217;d better see to it that the
anemones come out. I think it&#8217;s high
time. And, besides, one always feels
warmer when there are others shivering
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, as soon as the anemones had
heard the starling&#8217;s first whistle, they
carefully stuck their heads out of the
ground. But they were still so tightly
tucked up in their green wraps that
one could hardly see them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
looked like green buds which might
turn into anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early,&#8221; they whispered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame for the starling to call
us. There&#8217;s no one in the world left
that one can trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the swallow came:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tsee! Tsee!&#8221; he whistled and darted
through the air on his long,
pointed wings. &#8220;Out with you, you
silly flowers! Can&#8217;t you see that
Dame Spring has come?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the anemones had become careful.
They just pushed their green
wraps a little to one side and peeped
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;One swallow does not make a summer,&#8221;
they said. &#8220;Where is your
wife? You have only come to see if
it&#8217;s possible to live here and now
you&#8217;re trying to take us in. But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
are not so stupid as all that. We
know that, if once we catch cold,
we&#8217;re done for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pack of poltroons,&#8221; said
the swallow and sat down on the
weathercock on the ranger&#8217;s roof and
looked out over the landscape.</p>

<p>But the anemones stood and waited
and were very cold. One or two of
them, who could not control their impatience,
cast off their wraps in the
sun. The cold killed them at night
and the story of their pitiful death
went from flower to flower and
aroused great consternation.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Then Dame Spring came, one delightfully
mild and still night.</p>

<p>No one knows what she looks like,
for no one has ever seen her. But all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
long for her and thank her and bless
her. She goes through the wood and
touches the flowers and the trees and
they bud at once. She goes through
the stables and unfastens the animals
and lets them out into the field. She
goes straight into men&#8217;s hearts and
makes them glad. She makes it difficult
for the best-behaved boy to sit
still on his bench at school and occasions
a terrible lot of mistakes in the
exercise-books.</p>

<p>But she does not do this all at once.
She attends to her business night after
night and comes first to those who
long for her most.</p>

<p>So it happened that, on the very
night when she arrived, she went
straight off to the anemones, who
stood in their green wraps and could
no longer curb their impatience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>And one, two, three! There they
stood in newly-ironed white frocks
and looked so fresh and pretty that
the starlings sang their finest songs
for sheer joy at the sight of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely it is here!&#8221; said the
anemones. &#8220;How warm the sun is!
And how the birds sing! It is a thousand
times better than last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they say this every year, so it
doesn&#8217;t count.</p>

<p>Now there were many others who
went quite off their heads when they
saw that the anemones were out.
There was a schoolboy who wanted
to have his summer holidays then and
there and then there was the beech,
who was most offended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you coming to me soon,
Dame Spring?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am a
much more important person than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
those silly anemones and really I can
no longer control my buds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; replied
Dame Spring. &#8220;But you must
give me a little time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on through the wood. And,
at every step, more anemones appeared.
They stood in thick bevies
round the roots of the beech and
bashfully bowed their round heads to
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look up freely,&#8221; said Dame
Spring, &#8220;and rejoice in heaven&#8217;s
bright sun. Your lives are but short,
so you must enjoy them while they last.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anemones did as she told them.
They stretched themselves and spread
their white petals to every side and
drank as much sunshine as they
could. They knocked their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
against one another and wound their
stalks together and laughed and
were constantly happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I can wait no longer,&#8221; said
the beech and came into leaf.</p>

<p>Leaf after leaf crept out of its
green covering and spread out and
fluttered in the wind. The whole
green crown arched itself like a
mighty roof above the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, is it evening so
soon?&#8221; asked the anemones, who
thought that it had turned quite
dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is <i>death</i>,&#8221; said Dame
Spring. &#8220;Now <i>you&#8217;re</i> finished. It&#8217;s
the same with you as with the best in
this world. All must bud, blossom
and die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Die?&#8221; cried some of the small
anemones. &#8220;Must we die yet?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>And some of the large anemones
turned quite red in the face with anger
and pride:</p>

<p>&#8220;We know all about it!&#8221; they said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the beech that&#8217;s killing us. He
steals the sunshine for his own leaves
and grudges us a single ray. He is a
nasty, wicked thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood and scolded and wept
for some days. Then Dame Spring
came for the last time through the
wood. She had still the oaks and
some other querulous old fellows to
visit:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down nicely to sleep now in
the ground,&#8221; she said to the anemones.
&#8220;It is no use kicking against
the pricks. Next year, I will come
again and wake you to new life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And some of the anemones did as
she told them. But others continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to stick their heads in the air and
grew up so ugly and lanky that they
were horrid to look at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fie, for shame!&#8221; they cried to the
beech-leaves. &#8220;It&#8217;s you that are killing
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the beech shook his long
boughs, so that the brown husks fell
to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till the autumn, you little
blockheads,&#8221; he said and laughed.
&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll just see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The anemones could not understand
what he meant. But, when they had
stretched themselves as far as they
could, they cracked in two and withered.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>The summer was past and the
farmer had carted his corn home
from the field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>The wood was still green, but darker;
and, in many places, yellow and
red leaves appeared among the green
ones. The sun was tired of his warm
work during the summer and went
early to bed.</p>

<p>At night, the winter stole through
the trees to see if his time would
soon come. When he found a flower,
he kissed her politely and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, are you there still? I
am glad to see you. Stay where you
are. I am a harmless old man and
wouldn&#8217;t hurt a fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the flower shuddered with his
kiss and the bright dew-drops that
hung from her petals froze to ice at
the same moment.</p>

<p>The winter went oftener and oftener
through the wood. He breathed upon
the leaves, so that they turned yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
or upon the ground, so that it
grew hard.</p>

<p>Even the anemones, who lay down
below in the earth and waited for
Dame Spring to come again as she
had promised, could feel his breath
and shuddered right down to their
roots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, how cold it is!&#8221; they said
to one another. &#8220;How ever shall we
last through the winter? We are sure
to die before it is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now <i>my</i> time has come,&#8221; said the
winter. &#8220;Now I need no longer steal
round like a thief in the night. From
to-morrow I shall look everybody
straight in the face and bite his nose
and make his eyes run with tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>At night the storm broke loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see you make a clean sweep
of things,&#8221; said the winter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>And the storm obeyed his orders.
He tore howling through the wood
and shook the branches so that they
creaked and broke. Any that were at
all decayed fell down and those that
held on had to twist and turn to every
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with all that finery!&#8221;
howled the storm and tore off the
leaves. &#8220;This is no time to deck one&#8217;s
self out. Soon there will be snow on
the branches: that&#8217;s another story.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the leaves fell terrified to the
ground, but the storm did not let
them be in peace. He took them by
the waist and waltzed with them over
the field, high up in the air and
into the wood again, swept them together
into great heaps and scattered
them once more to every side, just as
the fit seized him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Not until the morning did the
storm grow weary and go down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can have peace for <i>this</i>
time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am going down
till we have our spring-cleaning.
Then we can have another dance, if
there are any of you left by that
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the leaves went to rest and
lay like a thick carpet over the whole
earth.</p>

<p>The anemones felt that it had
grown delightfully warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Dame Spring can have
come yet?&#8221; they asked one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got my buds ready!&#8221;
cried one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more have I! No more have I!&#8221;
exclaimed the others in chorus.</p>

<p>But one of them took courage and
just peeped out above the ground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;Good-morning!&#8221; cried the withered
beech-leaves. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather too
early, little missie: if only you don&#8217;t
come to any harm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Dame Spring?&#8221; asked
the anemone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just yet,&#8221; replied the beech-leaves.
&#8220;It&#8217;s we, the green leaves you
were so angry with in the summer.
Now we have lost our green color
and have not much left to make a
show of. We have enjoyed our youth
and danced, I may tell you. And
now we are lying here and protecting
all the little flowers in the
ground against the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And meanwhile I am standing
and freezing with my bare branches,&#8221;
said the beech, crossly.</p>

<p>The anemones talked about it down
in the earth and thought it very nice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Those dear beech-leaves!&#8221; they
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you remember it next summer,
when I come into leaf,&#8221; said the
beech.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will, we will!&#8221; whispered the
anemones.</p>

<p>For that sort of thing is promised;
but the promise is never kept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE QUEEN BEE</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span><small>HE</small> farmer opened his bee-hive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with you!&#8221; he said. &#8220;The sun
is shining; the flowers are blossoming
everywhere and are a sheer joy
to behold. Let me see you industrious
now and gather me a good lot
of honey which I can sell to the shopkeeper
in the autumn. Many mickles
make a muckle; and you know that
things are looking bad with agriculture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is agriculture to us?&#8221; said
the bees.</p>

<p>But they flew out nevertheless, for
they had been in the hive all winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and were longing for a breath of
fresh air. Buzzing and humming,
they stretched their legs and tried
their wings. They swarmed forth
everywhere, crawled up and down
the hive, flew off to the flowers and
shrubs and walked about on the
ground.</p>

<p>There were many hundred bees.</p>

<p>The queen came last. She was bigger
than the others and it was she
that reigned in the hive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that nonsense now, children,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and begin to do something.
A decent bee does not idle, but turns
to, in a capable way, and makes good
use of her time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she divided them into companies
and set them to work.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, there, fly out and see if there
is any honey in the flowers. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
company can gather pollen; and,
when you come home, deliver it all
nicely to the old bees indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>They flew away. But all the young
ones were still left. They formed the
last company, for they had never
been out before.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are <i>we</i> to do?&#8221; they asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You? You&#8217;ve got to <i>sweat</i>!&#8221; said
the queen. &#8220;One, two, three and to
work!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they sweated as best they knew
how and the loveliest yellow wax
burst out of their bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the queen.
&#8220;Now we will begin to build.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old bees took the wax and
started building a number of small
hexagonal cells, all alike and close
together. All the time that they were
building, the others came flying up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with pollen and honey, which they
laid at the queen&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll knead the dough!&#8221; said
she. &#8220;But first pour a little honey in;
then it will taste better.&#8221;</p>

<p>They kneaded and kneaded and
made nice little loaves of bee-bread,
which they carried to the cells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll go on building!&#8221; commanded
the queen-bee. And they
sweated wax and built away with a
vengeance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may as well begin my own
work,&#8221; said the queen and heaved a
deep sigh, for this was the hardest of
all.</p>

<p>She sat down in the middle of the
hive and began to lay eggs. She laid
great heaps and the bees ran up,
took the little eggs in their mouths
and carried them into the new cells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Every egg got its own little room;
and, when they were all disposed of,
the queen ordered the bees to put
doors to the cells and to shut them
tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; she said, when they had
finished. &#8220;Now you can build me ten
big, handsome rooms at the outer
edge of the hive.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bees did so in a trice and then
the queen laid ten beautiful eggs,
one in each of the big rooms, and put
a door before them.</p>

<p>Every day, the bees flew out and in
and gathered great heaps of honey
and pollen; but, in the evening, when
their work was done, they set the
doors a little ajar and peeped in at
the eggs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; said the queen, one
day. &#8220;Now they&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>And suddenly all the eggs burst
and in each cell lay a nice little baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;What queer creatures!&#8221; said the
young bees. &#8220;Why, they have no
eyes; and where are their legs and
wings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are grubs,&#8221; said the queen,
&#8220;and that&#8217;s what you young green-horns
yourselves once looked like.
You have to be a grub before you
can become a proper bee. Hurry
now and give them something to
eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bees hastened to feed the little
young ones; but they did not all fare
equally well. The ten that lay in the
large rooms got as much to eat as
ever they wanted and a big helping
of honey was carried in to them every
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are princesses,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
queen. &#8220;Therefore, you must treat
them well. The others you can stint
in their food; they are only work-people
and must accustom themselves
to take things as they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the poor little creatures got a
small piece of bee-bread every morning
and nothing more; they had to be
content with that, even though they
were ever so hungry.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>In one of the small hexagonal cells
close to the princesses&#8217; rooms lay a
tiny little grub. She was the youngest
of them all and had but quite
lately come out of the egg. She
could not see, but she could distinctly
hear the grown-up bees talking outside;
and meanwhile she lay quite still
and just thought her own thoughts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8220;I could do with a little more to
eat,&#8221; she said and tapped at her
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got enough for today,&#8221;
replied the old bee who crawled up
and down outside in the passage
and had been appointed head-nurse
to the baby bees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but I&#8217;m hungry!&#8221; cried the little
grub. &#8220;And then I want to have
a princess&#8217;s room; I feel so cramped
in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just listen to her!&#8221; said the old
bee, sarcastically. &#8220;One would think
she was a dainty little princess by the
pretensions she puts forward! You
were born to toil and drudge, my
little friend. A common working-bee,
that&#8217;s what you are; and you&#8217;ll
never be anything else in all your
days.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, but I want to be a queen!&#8221;
said the grub and thumped on the
door.</p>

<p>The old bee, of course, made no reply
to such silly trash, but went on to
the others. Everywhere they were
crying for more food; and the little
grub could hear it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;that we should be so hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she tapped on the wall
and called to the princess on the other
side:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a little of your honey!
Let me come in to you in your room.
I am lying here and starving and I
am quite as good as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you just wait till I&#8217;m queen-regnant!&#8221;
said the princess. &#8220;Be sure
I shan&#8217;t forget your impudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had hardly said this before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the other princesses began to bawl
most terribly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t be queen! <i>I</i> will! <i>I</i>
will!&#8221; they all yelled together and
began to thump on the walls and
make a frightful din.</p>

<p>The head-nurse came running up at
once and opened the doors:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your Royal Highnesses&#8217;
commands?&#8221; she asked and curtseyed
and scraped with her legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;More honey!&#8221; they all cried together.
&#8220;But me first, me first! I&#8217;m
going to be queen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This minute, this minute, your
Royal Highnesses!&#8221; she replied and
ran off as fast as her six old legs
could carry her.</p>

<p>Soon after, she came back with several
other bees. They dragged a
quantity of honey with them, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they put down the throats of the
angry little princesses, till gradually
they grew quiet and all ten of them
went to sleep.</p>

<p>But the little grub lay awake and
thought over what had happened.
She was yearning for honey and
shook the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me some honey! I can stand
this no longer; I&#8217;m quite as good as
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old bee told her to be silent:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still, you little squaller!
Here comes the queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the queen-bee came as she
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; she said to the bees. &#8220;I
wish to be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood long, silently, outside the
princesses&#8217; rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lying in there now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sleeping,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;Eat and
sleep, that&#8217;s what you do, from morn
till night, and, every day that passes,
you grow stronger and fatter. In
a few days, you will be full-grown
and you will creep out of the cells.
Then my time is over. I know it well!
I have heard the bees saying among
themselves that they want a younger
and prettier queen; and then they will
drive me away in disgrace. But that
I will not submit to. To-morrow, I
shall kill them all, so that I can go on
reigning till I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she went away, but the little
grub had heard all that she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;After all, it&#8217;s really a pity for the
little princesses. They certainly give
themselves airs and they have been
nasty to me; but it would be sad, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
all that, if the wicked queen killed
them. I think I shall tell the old
grumbler in the passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she began to tap at the door
again; and the old head-nurse came
running up; but this time she was
really angry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you had better mind yourself,
my good grub!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the youngest of them all
and the noisiest. Next time, I&#8217;ll report
you to the queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but first listen to me,&#8221; said the
grub; and then she betrayed the
queen&#8217;s wicked plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens above! Is that true?&#8221;
cried the old bee and struck her
wings together with horror.</p>

<p>And, without listening to any more,
she hurried away to tell the other
bees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&#8220;I do think I deserve a little honey
for my goodwill,&#8221; said the little
grub. &#8220;But now I can go to sleep
with an easy conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning, the queen, when
she thought that all the bees were in
bed, came to put the princesses to
death. The grub could hear her talking
aloud to herself; but was very
frightened of the wicked queen and
hardly dared move.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only she doesn&#8217;t kill the princesses,&#8221;
she thought and crept closer
to the door to hear what was happening.</p>

<p>The queen-bee looked carefully
round in every direction and opened
the first of the doors. But, as she did
so, the bees swarmed up from every
side, seized her by the legs and wings
and dragged her away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; she
screamed. &#8220;Are you rising in rebellion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your Majesty,&#8221; replied the
bees, respectfully, &#8220;but we know that
you are thinking of killing the princesses;
and that you cannot possibly
be permitted to do. How should we
manage in that case in the autumn,
when your Majesty dies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unhand me!&#8221; screamed the queen
and tried to tear herself free. &#8220;I am
still queen and have the right to do
what I please. How do you know that
I shall die in the autumn?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the bees held fast and dragged
her out of the hive. There they let
her go; but she shook her wings with
rage and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are disloyal subjects, who are
not worth reigning over. I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
stay here another hour, but will go
away and build a new hive. Are there
any of you that will follow me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the old bees who had been
grubs with the queen declared that
they would go with her, and soon
after they flew away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we have no queen,&#8221; said the
others. &#8220;We shall have to take good
care of the princesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they stuffed them with honey
from morning till night and the
princesses grew and thrived and
squabbled and made more and more
noise day after day.</p>

<p>And no one gave a thought to the
little grub.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>One morning, the doors of the princesses&#8217;
rooms flew open and they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ten came out as beautiful full-grown
queen-bees; the other bees came running
up and looked at them with admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely they are!&#8221; they
said. &#8220;It is not easy to say which of
them is the prettiest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221; cried one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a great mistake!&#8221; said
the second and thrust at her with her
sting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You flatter yourselves!&#8221; cried the
third. &#8220;I should think I am no less
beautiful than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon they were all screaming together;
and, a little later, they all began
to fight. The bees wanted to
part them, but the old head-nurse
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just let them fight, then we shall
see which is the strongest and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
will elect her to be our queen.
After all, we can&#8217;t have more than
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bees then formed a ring and
watched the combat. It was long and
hard-fought. Wings and legs were
bitten off and flew around in the air;
and, after some time, eight of the
princesses lay dead on the ground.
The last two went on fighting for a
long while. One had lost all her
wings and the other had only four
legs left.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a pitiful queen, whichever
of them we get,&#8221; said one of the
bees. &#8220;We had better have kept the
old one.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she might as well have saved
herself the observation, for at that
very moment the princesses suddenly
gave each other so violent a thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with their stings that both of them
fell stone-dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a nice thing!&#8221; cried the
bees and they all ran about in consternation.
&#8220;Now we have no queen!
What shall we do? What shall we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>They crept round the hive in utter
bewilderment and despair. But the
oldest and wisest of them sat in a
corner and held counsel. They discussed
at length what expedient they
should resort to in this unfortunate
case; but at last the head-nurse spoke
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I will tell you how you can
get out of the dilemma, if you will
follow my advice. I remember that
the same misfortune once happened
long ago in this hive. I was a grub at
the time and I lay in my cell and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
distinctly heard what was going on.
All the princesses had killed one another
and the old queen had gone
away, just as now. But then the bees
took one of us grubs and put her in
one of the princesses&#8217; cells. They fed
her every day on the best and finest
honey that the hive contained; and,
when she was full-grown, she was a
really good and beautiful queen. I
remember the whole story clearly,
for I thought at the time that they
might just as well have taken me.
But never mind that at present. I
propose that we should behave in
just the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bees gladly cried that they
agreed, and they ran straight off to
fetch a grub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop a bit,&#8221; cried the head-nurse,
&#8220;and take me with you. After all, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
have managed to help you. Now, look
here: it must be one of the youngest
grubs, for she must have time to
think of her new position. When
you&#8217;ve been brought up to be a common
worker, it&#8217;s not so easy to accustom
yourself to wear a crown.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bees thought this sensible too,
and the old bee continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just beside the princesses&#8217; rooms
lies a little grub. She is the youngest
of them all. She must have learned a
deal from hearing the princesses&#8217; cultured
conversation; and I have noticed
that she is not without character.
Moreover, it was she who had the
honesty to tell me of the old queen&#8217;s
wicked thoughts. Let us take her.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all went forthwith, in a solemn
procession, to the narrow, hexagonal
cell in which the little grub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
lay. The head-nurse knocked politely
at the door, opened it carefully and
told the grub what the bees had decided
upon. At first she almost refused
to believe her own ears; but,
when they carried her carefully into
one of the beautiful large rooms and
brought her as much honey as she
could eat, she saw that it was serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am to be queen after all!&#8221; she
said to the head-nurse. &#8220;You never
thought that, you old grumbler!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope your Majesty will forget
my rude remarks at the time when
you lay in the hexagonal cell,&#8221; said
the old bee and dropped a respectful
curtsey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you!&#8221; replied the new-fledged
princess. &#8220;Get me some more
honey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after, the grub was full-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and stepped out of her room,
looking as large and beautiful as the
bees could possibly wish. And she did
know how to command and no mistake!</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;We
want more honey for winter use and
you others must sweat more wax. I
mean to build a wing to the hive. The
new princesses will live in it next
year; it is much too unpleasant for
them to be so near the common
grubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What next!&#8221; cried the bees to one
another. &#8220;One would really think that
she had been queen from the time
when she lay in the egg!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the head-nurse, &#8220;that she
was not. But she has had <i>queenly
thoughts</i>; and that is the great
thing.&#8221;</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span><small>HE</small> whole kitchen-garden was full
of caterpillars and one of them was
bigger than the others. Day after
day, he crawled about on a head of
cabbage just at the edge of the walk.
He was stout and fat and so green
that it hurt one&#8217;s eyes to look at him.
He ate and ate, positively did nothing
else but eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stupid beast!&#8221; said the gardener.
&#8220;You and your brothers and
sisters eat up half my cabbage. If
there were not so many of you, I
would kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stupid beast!&#8221; sang the nightingale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
who sat in the syringa-bush.
&#8220;He does not care about flowers or
music and singing. Nothing but eat,
eat, eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stupid beast!&#8221; piped the swallow
who swept over the kitchen-garden
on his long, pointed wings. &#8220;He
has not the smallest taste for poetry:
never thinks of sunshine and summer
air. There is not the least go in him.
Nothing but eat, eat, eat! And then,
into the bargain, he is so full of
loathsome poisonous hairs that one
can&#8217;t eat him one&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stupid beast!&#8221; snapped the
ant, who ran past with a grain of
corn in her mouth. &#8220;Does he ever
think of house and home? Of his
children? Of food for the winter?
Nothing but eat, eat, eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; said the caterpillar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>And he said no more for the time
being, so overpowered was he with
all this scolding. But, all the while
that he was eating the green, juicy
cabbage, he pondered on what he
had heard and most on what the ant
had said. And, when the ant next
came by, the caterpillar had made
it out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, you ant!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Stop a bit
and explain to me what you said
about the children. Don&#8217;t you know
that I am a child myself? I only
want time in order to grow big and
pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ant stood still and dropped the
grain of corn she had in her mouth,
so great was her amazement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are <i>you</i> a child?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;A
nice child you are! Why, you&#8217;re a
perfect elephant, fifty times as big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as myself. And so you&#8217;re a child, are
you? Lord knows what you&#8217;ll look
like when you&#8217;re grown up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know for certain,&#8221; said the
caterpillar, with an air of mystery.
&#8220;But I have a suspicion. If I could
only tell you what I sometimes notice
inside myself! I am quite certain that
I shall be something great one day&mdash;if
only you give me time to grow.
I shall fly away over the garden on
beautiful wings; I shall be a butterfly:
just you wait and see! I know by
my dreams that I am related to you
others and that I am quite as good as
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said the ant and spat on the
ground. &#8220;It is simply disgusting to
listen to such balderdash. Dreams?
Suspicions? No, there&#8217;s a thing that&#8217;s
called the family and the ant-hill:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that&#8217;s what <i>I</i> stick to. Good-bye, you
stupid caterpillar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she ran off, but stopped a little
farther away and once more said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the sun blazed and the caterpillar
basked in its rays while he ate
the green cabbage.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>It was now past mid-day and the
nightingale in the syringa-bush could
not bear to sing in so great a heat.
So he stopped and took an afternoon
nap. The swallow flew up aloft to
get a breath of fresh air, the ant carried
her little white eggs up into the
sun and the gardener sat under the
big walnut-tree and had his dinner
with his wife and children.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>But the caterpillar went on eating
indefatigably.</p>

<p>Suddenly a multitude of small
black dots appeared in the air over
the kitchen-garden. They danced up
and down and up and down. At last,
they hung low down, just above the
caterpillar, and he could see that they
were nice little animals, with fine,
bright wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? What do you want?&#8221;
asked the caterpillar.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are mothers,&#8221; replied the little
animals, &#8220;and we have come out to
look for a place for our children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right and proper
enough,&#8221; said the caterpillar, who
was thinking of what the ant had
said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t like you, for all
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very sad,&#8221; said the animalcules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
&#8220;for we just happen to be so
awfully fond of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, at that moment, a number
of them settled on the caterpillar&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;Murder!
Help! Police!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little animals flew up again, but
remained hovering in the air above
the caterpillar.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who are you?&#8221; he asked and
writhed with pain. &#8220;What have I
done to you that you should ill-treat
me so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one provides for himself
and his,&#8221; replied the animalcules,
&#8220;and we have now provided for our
children. We are parasitic flies and
our name is Ichneumon: it is not a
pretty one, but it happens to be the
best we have. For the rest, we are relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the ants, if you happen to
know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good enough family,&#8221; said
the caterpillar and sighed. &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t know why everybody should
scold at me and sting me and scoff
at me. What is this that you have
done to me now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know soon enough,&#8221; said
the ichneumons. &#8220;Good-bye for the
present and thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they soared up aloft and became
little black dots again and, at
last, disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>But the caterpillar heaved long and
deep sighs and ate twice as much cabbage
to console himself. Nevertheless,
he could not keep from thinking
of the uncomfortable visit he had
had:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a suspicion,&#8221; he said to himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
&#8220;An awkward suspicion. If only
I could make something of it!&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>But, when some time had passed, he
began to make something of it.</p>

<p>He simply could not satisfy his appetite
any longer. The more he ate,
the hungrier he became. He munched
one piece of cabbage-leaf after another
and, nevertheless, he felt quite
faint with hunger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of <i>this</i> now?&#8221;
he said, despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s we!&#8221; answered something inside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? What?&#8221; said the caterpillar
and rolled round with terror. &#8220;Am
I haunted inside, or have I gone
mad?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s we, it&#8217;s the ichneumon-flies&#8217;
young,&#8221; came the sound again from
deep down in his stomach.</p>

<p>The caterpillar&#8217;s head was in a
whirl. But, when he had collected
himself a little, he began to understand:</p>

<p>&#8220;So the ichneumons laid their eggs
in my body!&#8221; he cried, in despair.
&#8220;And have I now to feed all their
voracious young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; said the young ones.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it to a T. Bestir yourself
now, you stupid, lazy caterpillar,
and eat till you burst, or we&#8217;ll eat
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, they took a good nip at
his flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; yelled the caterpillar. &#8220;I
will, I will, indeed I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but hurry up!&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
young ones. &#8220;We are so hungry, so
hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the caterpillar ate ever so much
more than before, but it was not
the slightest use. He could never
eat enough and the ichneumon-flies&#8217;
young kept on crying for more. The
ant and the swallow and the nightingale
mocked at him every day and
the gardener beat the cabbage with
his rake, so angry was he at all this
consumption.</p>

<p>But the caterpillar swallowed it all
and reflected that there was not on
earth a lot so distressing as his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeer away!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;You&#8217;re
quick at that. If only you knew that
I don&#8217;t get the food myself which I
procure: the benefit of it all goes to
the ichneumon-flies&#8217; young.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ate and ate desperately. At last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he could bear it no longer. All day
long, he noticed how the ichneumons
were rummaging about inside him.
He rolled round on the cabbage-leaf
in despair and turned and twisted
and screamed for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather eat me up altogether while
you&#8217;re about it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Rather
let me die at once: I can&#8217;t endure this
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; said the young ones inside
him and cackled with laughter.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not so easy as that. You&#8217;ll be
eaten right enough, when the time
comes, never fear! But, for the present,
all you have to do is to hold your
tongue and eat.&#8221;</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Every day, the young ones grew
bigger and wanted more food. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
they could no longer satisfy themselves
with what the caterpillar ate,
they began to devour two large
lumps of fat which he had saved up
in the happy days before the ichneumons
came. They were meant to be
used for wings and legs, once he had
become a butterfly. And, when he noticed
that they were gone, he shed
bitter tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas for my beautiful dreams!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Now I shall never be a butterfly,
never flit in the sun all over the
garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you all the time that that
was nonsense about the butterfly,&#8221;
said the ant, who passed at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said the caterpillar. &#8220;If
you have a heart beating in your
body, then help me, Ant.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>Then he told her of his misfortune.
The swallow and the nightingale
came and listened and the caterpillar
implored them for advice and assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, I&#8217;m of your race,&#8221; he
ended by saying. &#8220;Believe me, I feel
it. If I get time and leisure, I shall
turn into something pretty, a butterfly.
I have felt that inside myself
since the time when I was quite
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>The swallow and the nightingale
looked at each other and shook their
heads. But the ant, who was the cleverest
of the three, nodded thoughtfully
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What you say about the relationship
may have something in it. To a
certain extent. For we are all poor
mortals, as the gardener says. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that bit about the butterfly is positively
nothing but imagination. I am
sorry for you, goodness knows I
am, but I can&#8217;t help you. You must
bear your lot with patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> bear it!&#8221; cried the caterpillar.
&#8220;It is killing me. Think of the
butterflies: are they not beautiful?
Don&#8217;t you like looking at them?
Help me, do you hear! If I die, a
butterfly dies. Only think, if one day
there were no butterflies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the ant, &#8220;as for that,
the world would go on, even if
you are right. There are caterpillars
enough in the garden and, if you
really <i>are</i> butterflies&#8217; children, there
would be plenty left, even though a
few did get lost. However, I have no
time to speculate on this folly. If you
wish to have my opinion in a nutshell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
here it is, that your mother
must have looked after you foolishly,
for you to fall into the ichneumons&#8217;
power like this. And now I
must go home and look after <i>my</i> children.
Good-bye and bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the ant went away. The nightingale
flew up into the bush and sang
in the warm evening so that all had
to listen and admire him and the
swallow soared high into the air and
prophesied fine weather for the morrow.</p>

<p>But the caterpillar crouched humbly
over his cabbage-leaf and ate.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>&#8220;I think there are too many of us
in here,&#8221; said one of the ichneumon-grubs
the next morning. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
breathe.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a way out of that,&#8221; said
one of the others. &#8220;Let&#8217;s bite a hole
in the creature&#8217;s air-ducts; then we&#8217;ll
get air enough. But see that he has
one or two left, or we shall risk his
going and suffocating before his
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no sooner said than done. But
the caterpillar screamed louder than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Air! Air! I shall die of suffocation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the young
ones. &#8220;But you had better accustom
yourself to be content with little.
Hurry back to the cabbage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s all up with me,&#8221; said the
caterpillar, one morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be right, this time,&#8221; replied
the ichneumon-grubs.</p>

<p>That evening, they ate the last remnant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of their host. Only the skin was
left of the dead caterpillar. It lay
dry and shrivelled up outside the
grubs, who nestled in it as in a warm
fur.</p>

<p>One fine day, they flew out. Pretty
little animals they were, with light,
bright wings, like their parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s
only a question of finding a caterpillar
for our young. Each for himself
and the devil take the hindmost: such
is nature&#8217;s law. We are nature&#8217;s police:
we see to it that things keep
their balance. It would be a hideous
world indeed, if it were full of caterpillars!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or of ichneumon-flies!&#8221; piped the
swallow and gulped down a mouthful
of them as he spoke.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BEECH AND THE
OAK</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">I</span><small>T</small> was in the old days.</p>

<p>There were no towns with houses
and streets and towering church-steeples.
There were no schools. For
there were not many boys and those
there were learnt from their fathers
to shoot with a bow and arrow, to
hunt the deer in his hiding-place, to
kill bears in order to make clothes of
their hides and to get fire by rubbing
two pieces of wood together. When
they knew all this thoroughly, their
education was completed.</p>

<p>Nor were there any railways, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
tilled fields, or ships on the sea, or
books, for there was nobody who
would read them.</p>

<p>There was hardly anything but
trees.</p>

<p>But then of trees there were plenty.
They stood everywhere, from coast
to coast, mirrored themselves in every
river and sea and stretched their
mighty branches up into the sky.
They stooped out over the sea-shore,
dipped their branches in the black
water of the marshes and looked out
haughtily over the land from the tall
hills.</p>

<p>They all knew one another, for they
belonged to one big family and they
were proud of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all oak-trees,&#8221; they said
and drew themselves up. &#8220;We own
the land and we govern it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>And they were quite right, for there
were only very few people at that
time. Otherwise there was nothing
but wild animals. Bears, wolves and
foxes went hunting, while the deer
grazed by the edge of the marsh.
The wood-mouse sat outside her hole
eating acorns and the beaver built
his ingenious house on the river-bank.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Then, one day, the bear came trudging
along and lay down at full
length under a great oak-tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there again, you robber?&#8221;
said the oak and shook a heap of
withered leaves over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really ought not to be so
wasteful with your leaves, old
friend,&#8221; said the bear, licking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
paws. &#8220;They are the only thing you
have to keep off the sun with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like me, you can go
away,&#8221; replied the oak, proudly. &#8220;I
am lord of the land and, look where
you may, you will find none but my
brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough,&#8221; growled the bear.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just the tiresome part of it.
I&#8217;ve been for a little trip abroad, you
see, and have been a bit spoilt. That
was in a country down south. I there
took a nap under the beech-trees.
Those are tall, slender trees, not
crooked old fellows like you. And
their tops are so close that the sunbeams
can&#8217;t pierce through them at
all. It was a real delight to sleep
there of an afternoon, believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beech-trees?&#8221; asked the oak, curiously.
&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&#8220;You might wish that you were half
as handsome as a beech-tree,&#8221; said
the bear. &#8220;But now I&#8217;m not going to
gossip with you any more. I&#8217;ve had
to trot over a mile in front of a confounded
hunter, who caught me on
one of my hind-legs with an arrow.
Now I want to sleep; and perhaps
you will be so kind as to provide me
with rest, since you can&#8217;t provide me
with shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bear lay down and closed his
eyes, but there was no sleep for him
this time. For the other trees had
heard what he had said and there
came such a chattering and a jabbering
and a rustling of leaves
as had never been known in the
forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven knows what sort of trees
those are!&#8221; said the one. &#8220;Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it&#8217;s a story which the bear wants us
to swallow,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can trees be like whose
leaves are so close together that
the sunbeams can&#8217;t pierce through
them?&#8221; asked a little oak who had
been listening to what the big ones
were saying.</p>

<p>But next to him stood an old,
gnarled tree, who slapped the little
oak on the head with one of his lower
branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t talk till you&#8217;ve got something
to say. And you others need not believe
a word of the bear&#8217;s nonsense.
I am much taller than you and I can
see a long way over the forest. But
as far away as I can see there is nothing
but oak-trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little oak remained sheepish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and silent and the other big trees
whispered softly to one another, for
they had a great respect for the old
one.</p>

<p>But the bear got up and rubbed his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you have disturbed my afternoon
nap,&#8221; he growled, angrily,
&#8220;and I shall have my revenge on you,
never fear. When I come back, I
shall bring some beech-seed with me
and I&#8217;ll answer for it that you will
all turn yellow with envy when you
see how handsome the new trees
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he trotted away. But the oaks
talked to one another for days at a
time of the queer trees which he had
told them of.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they come, we&#8217;ll do for them!&#8221;
said the little oak-tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>But the old oak gave him one on the
head:</p>

<p>&#8220;If they come, you shall be civil to
them, you puppy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
they won&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Now this was where the old oak was
wrong, for they did come.</p>

<p>In the autumn, the bear returned
and lay down under the old oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to give you the kind regards
of the people down below there,&#8221; he
said and picked some funny little
things off his shaggy hide. &#8220;Just
look what I&#8217;ve got for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s beech,&#8221; replied the bear.
&#8220;Beech-seed, as I promised you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he trampled them into the
earth and prepared to leave again:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity that I can&#8217;t stay to see
how annoyed you will be,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but those confounded human beings
have become so offensive. They killed
my wife and one of my brothers the
other day and I must look out for a
place where I can dwell in peace.
There is hardly a spot left for an
honest bear to live in. Good-bye, you
gnarled old oak-trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the bear had jogged off, the
trees looked at one another seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us now see what happens,&#8221;
said the old oak.</p>

<p>And thereupon they betook themselves
to rest. The winter came and
tore all their leaves from them. The
snow lay high over all the land and
every tree stood plunged in his own
thoughts and dreamt of spring.</p>

<p>And, when the spring came, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
grass was green and the birds began
to sing where they last left off. The
flowers swarmed up out of the
ground and everything looked fresh
and vigorous.</p>

<p>The oaks alone still stood with leafless
branches:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very distinguished to come
last,&#8221; they said to one another. &#8220;The
king of the forest does not arrive
before the whole company is assembled.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at last they did arrive. All the
leaves burst forth from the fat buds
and the trees looked at one another
and complimented one another on
their good appearance. The little oak
had grown a decent bit. This made
him feel important and think that he
now had the right to join in the conversation:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much coming of the
bear&#8217;s beech-trees,&#8221; he said, mockingly,
but at the same time glanced
up anxiously at the old oak who used
to slap his head.</p>

<p>The old oak heard what he said and
so did the others. But they said nothing.
None of them had forgotten
what the bear had said and every
morning, when the sun shone, they
peeped down secretly to see if the
beeches had come. At bottom they
were a little anxious, but they were
too proud to talk about it.</p>

<p>And, one day, at last, the little
sprouts shot up from the ground.
The sun shone upon them and the
rain fell over them, so that it was not
long before they grew to a good
height.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, how pretty they are!&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the great oaks and twisted their
crooked branches still more, so as to
see them better.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome among us,&#8221; said
the old oak and gave them a gracious
nod. &#8220;You shall be my foster-children
and have just as good a time as
my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the little beeches
and not a word more.</p>

<p>But the little oak did not like the
strange trees:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful, the way you&#8217;re shooting
up,&#8221; he said, in a vexed tone.
&#8220;You&#8217;re already half as tall as I am.
May I beg you to remember that I
am much older than you and of a
good family besides?&#8221;</p>

<p>The beeches laughed with their tiny
little green leaves, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I bend my branches a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to one side, so that the sun can shine
on you better?&#8221; asked the old tree,
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; replied the beeches.
&#8220;We can grow quite nicely in the
shade.&#8221;</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>And all that summer passed and
another summer and still more. The
beeches went on growing steadily
and at last grew right over the little
oak&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your leaves to yourselves!&#8221;
cried the oak. &#8220;You&#8217;re standing in
my light; and that I can&#8217;t endure. I
must have proper sunshine. Take
your leaves away, else I shall die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beeches only laughed and went
on growing. At last, they met right
above the little oak&#8217;s head and then
he died.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;That was ill done!&#8221; roared the big
oaks and shook their branches in
anger.</p>

<p>But the old oak stood up for his
foster-children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serve him right!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the reward of his bragging. I say it,
although he is my own flesh and
blood. But you must be careful now,
you little beeches, for else I shall
slap you on the head too.&#8221;</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>The years passed and the beeches
kept on growing and gradually became
slim young trees that reached
right up among the old oak&#8217;s
branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re beginning to be rather intrusive
for my taste,&#8221; said the old
oak. &#8220;You had better try to grow a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bit thicker and give up shooting into
the air like that. Just look how your
branches stick out. Bend them decently,
as you see us do. How will
you manage when a regular storm
comes? Take it from me, the wind
shakes the tree-tops finely! He has
many a time come whistling through
my old branches; and how do you
think that you&#8217;ll come off, with that
meagre display which you stick up in
the air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one grows in his own manner
and we in ours,&#8221; replied the
young beeches. &#8220;This is the way it&#8217;s
done where we come from; and we
dare say we are just as good as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a very polite remark to
make to an old tree with moss on his
branches,&#8221; said the oak. &#8220;I am beginning
to regret that I was so good to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
you. If you have a scrap of honour
in your composition, then have the
kindness to move your leaves a little
to one side. Last year, there were
hardly any buds on my lower branches,
all through your standing in my
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t quite see what that has
to do with us,&#8221; replied the beeches.
&#8220;Every one has enough to do to look
after himself. If he is industrious
and successful, then things go well
with him. If not, he must be content
to go to the wall. Such is the way of
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the oak&#8217;s lower branches died
and he began to be terribly frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nice fellows, you are,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;the way you reward me for my
hospitality! When you were little, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
let you grow on my food and protected
you against the storm. I
let the sun shine on you whenever he
wanted to and I treated you as if you
were my own children. And now you
choke me by way of thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge!&#8221; said the beeches.</p>

<p>Then they blossomed and put forth
fruit and, when the fruit was ripe,
the wind shook their branches and
spread it all around.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are active people, like myself,&#8221;
said the wind. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I
like you and will gladly give you a
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the fox rolled at the foot of
the beech and filled his coat with
the prickly fruit and ran all over the
country with it. The bear did the same
and moreover laughed at the old oak
while he lay and rested in the shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the beech. The wood-mouse was
delighted with the new food which
he got and thought that beech-nuts
tasted much better than acorns.</p>

<p>New little beeches shot up round
about and grew just as quickly as
their parents and looked as green
and happy as if they did not know
what a bad conscience was.</p>

<p>But the old oak gazed out sadly
over the forest. The light beech-leaves
peeped forth on every hand
and the oaks sighed and told one another
their troubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are taking our power from
us,&#8221; they said and shook themselves
as well as they could for the beeches.
&#8220;The land is no longer ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>One branch died after the other and
the storm broke them off and flung
them to the ground. The old oak had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
now only a few leaves left in his
top.</p>

<p>&#8220;The end is at hand,&#8221; he said,
gravely.</p>

<p>But there were many more people
in the land now than before and they
hastened to cut down the oaks while
there were still some left:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oak makes better timber than
beech,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So at last we get a little appreciation,&#8221;
said the old oak. &#8220;But we shall
have to pay for it with our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he said to the beech-trees:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was I thinking of, when I
helped you on in your youth? What
an old fool I have been! We oak-trees
used to be lords of the land and
now, year after year, I have had to
see my brothers all around succumb
in the struggle against you. I myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
am almost done for and not one of
my acorns has shot up, thanks to
your shadow. But, before I die, I
should like to know what you call
your behaviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s soon said, old friend!&#8221; replied
the beeches. &#8220;We call it competition
and it&#8217;s no discovery of ours.
It&#8217;s that which rules the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know those foreign words
of yours,&#8221; said the oak. &#8220;<i>I</i> call it
rank ingratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he died.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WEEDS</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">I</span><small>T</small> was a fine and fruitful year.</p>

<p>Rain and sunshine came turn and
turn about, in just the way that was
best for the corn. No sooner did the
farmer think that it was getting
rather dry, than he could be quite
sure that it would rain the next day.
And, if he was of opinion that he
had had rain enough, then the clouds
parted at once, just as though it
were the farmer that was in command.</p>

<p>The farmer, therefore, was in a
good humour and did not complain,
as otherwise he always did. Glad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
rejoicing, he walked over the land
with his two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a splendid harvest this
year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall get my barns
full and make lots of money. Then
Jens and Ole shall have a new pair
of trousers apiece and I will take
them with me to market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t cut me soon, farmer,
I shall be lying down flat,&#8221; said the
rye and bowed her heavy ears right
down to the ground.</p>

<p>Now the farmer could not hear
this, but was quite able to see what
the rye was thinking of; and so he
went home to fetch his sickle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing to be in the service
of men,&#8221; said the rye. &#8220;I can be
sure now that all my grains will be
well taken care of. Most of them will
go to the mill and that, certainly, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not very pleasant. But afterwards
they will turn into beautiful fresh
bread; and one must suffer something
for honour&#8217;s sake. What remains
the farmer will keep and sow
next year on his land.&#8221;</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Along the hedge and beside the
ditch stood the weeds. Thistle and
burdock, poppy and bell-flower and
dandelion grew in thick clusters and
all had their heads full of seed. For
them too it had been a fruitful year,
for the sun shines and the rain falls
on the poor weeds just as much as on
the rich corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one to cut us and cart
us to the barn,&#8221; said the dandelion
and shook her head, but very carefully,
lest the seed should fall out too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
soon. &#8220;What is to become of our children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It gives me a headache to think of
it,&#8221; said the poppy. &#8220;Here I stand,
with many hundreds of seeds in my
head, and I have no idea where to
dispose of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask the rye&#8217;s advice,&#8221; said the
burdock.</p>

<p>And then they asked the rye what
they ought to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do to mix in other people&#8217;s
affairs when one&#8217;s well off,&#8221;
said the rye. &#8220;There is only one piece
of advice that I will give you: mind
you don&#8217;t fling your silly seed over
my field, or you&#8217;ll have me to deal
with!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this advice was of no use to
the wild flowers and they stood all
day pondering as to what they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
do. When the sun went down, they
closed their petals to go to sleep, but
they dreamt all night of their seed
and the next morning they had found
a remedy.</p>

<p>The poppy was the first to wake.</p>

<p>She carefully opened some little
shutters in the top of her head, so
that the sun could shine right in upon
the seeds. Next, she called to the
morning-wind, who was running and
playing along the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear wind,&#8221; she said, pleasantly.
&#8220;Will you do me a service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said the wind. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind having something to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mere trifle,&#8221; said the poppy.
&#8220;I will only ask you to give a
good shake to my stalk, so that my
seeds can fly far away out of the
shutters.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; said the wind.</p>

<p>And away flew the seeds to every
side. The stalk certainly snapped;
but that the poppy did not bother
about. For, when one has provided
well for one&#8217;s children, there&#8217;s really
nothing left to do in this world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said the wind and
wanted to go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a bit,&#8221; said the poppy.
&#8220;Promise me first that you won&#8217;t tell
the others. Else they might have the
same idea and then there would be
less room for my seed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be silent as the grave,&#8221; said
the wind and ran away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pst! Pst!&#8221; said the bell-flower.
&#8220;Have you a moment to do me a tiny
little service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the wind. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I only wanted to ask you to
shake me a little,&#8221; said the bell-flower.
&#8220;I have opened some of the
shutters in my head and I should like
to have my seed sent a good distance
out into the world. But you must be
sure not to tell the others, or they
might think of doing the same
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord preserve us!&#8221; said the wind
and laughed. &#8220;I shall be mute as a
fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he gave the flower a thorough
good shaking and went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear wind, dear wind!&#8221; cried the
dandelion. &#8220;Where are you off to so
fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything the matter with
you too?&#8221; asked the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; said the dandelion. &#8220;I
only wanted a word with you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;Then be quick about it,&#8221; said the
wind, &#8220;for I am thinking seriously
of going down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said the dandelion, &#8220;it&#8217;s
very difficult for us this year to get
all our seed settled; and yet one
would like to do the best one can
for one&#8217;s children. How the bell-flower
and the poppy and the poor
burdock will manage I do not
know, upon my word. But the thistle
and I have combined and have
hit upon an expedient. You shall
help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes four in all,&#8221; thought
the wind and could not help laughing
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; asked
the dandelion. &#8220;I saw you whispering
with the bell-flower and the poppy
just now; but, if you tell them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
thing, then you will simply get nothing
out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221; said
the wind. &#8220;Mum&#8217;s the word! What
is it you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve put out a nice little umbrella
right up at the top of our seed.
It&#8217;s the sweetest little toy you can
think of. If you only just blow on
me, it will fly up in the air and fall
down wherever you please. Will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the wind.</p>

<p>And, whoosh! he blew over the
thistle and the dandelion and took all
their seeds with him across the fields.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>The burdock still stood pondering.
She was thick-headed and that was
why she took so long. But, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
evening, a hare jumped over the
hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide me! Save me!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Farmer&#8217;s Trust is after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Creep round behind the hedge,&#8221;
said the burdock; &#8220;then I&#8217;ll hide you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look to me as if you
were cut out for the job,&#8221; said the
hare; &#8220;but beggars can&#8217;t be choosers.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he hid behind the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, in return, you might take
some of my seeds to the fields with
you,&#8221; said the burdock and she broke
off some of her many burs and scattered
them over the hare.</p>

<p>Soon after, Trust came running
along the hedge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the dog!&#8221; whispered the
burdock and, with a bound, the hare
leapt the hedge into the rye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>&#8220;Have you seen the hare?&#8221; asked
Trust. &#8220;I can see that I&#8217;m getting
too old for hunting. One of my eyes
is quite blind and my nose can no
longer find the scent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him,&#8221; replied the burdock,
&#8220;and, if you will do me a service,
I will show you where he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trust agreed and the burdock stuck
some of her burs on to his back and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you just rub yourself
against the stile here, inside the field?
But that&#8217;s not where you&#8217;re to look
for the hare, for I saw him run into
the wood a little while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trust carried the burs to the field
and ran off to the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now I&#8217;ve got my seeds settled,&#8221;
said the burdock and laughed to herself
contentedly. &#8220;But goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
knows how the thistle is going to
manage and the dandelion and the
bell-flower and the poppy!&#8221;</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>Next spring, already the rye stood
quite high.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are well off, considering all
things,&#8221; said the rye-stalks. &#8220;Here we
are in a great company that contains
none but our own good family. And
we don&#8217;t hamper one another in the
very least. It&#8217;s really an excellent
thing to be in the service of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, one fine day, a number of little
poppies and thistles and dandelions
and burdocks and bell-flowers stuck
their heads up above the ground in
the midst of the luxuriant rye.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this now?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
asked the rye. &#8220;How in the world
did <i>you</i> get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the poppy looked at the bell-flower
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did <i>you</i> get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the thistle looked at the burdock
and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth did <i>you</i> get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all equally surprised and
it was some time before they had
done explaining. But the rye was the
angriest and, when she had heard all
about Trust and the hare and the
wind, she was quite furious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness that the farmer
shot the hare in the autumn,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;And Trust, luckily, is dead too,
the old scamp! So I have no further
quarrel with <i>them</i>. But how dare the
wind carry the seed of the weeds on
to the farmer&#8217;s land!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;Softly, softly, you green rye!&#8221;
said the wind, who had been lying
behind the hedge and had heard all
this. &#8220;I ask no one&#8217;s leave, but do as
I please; and now I shall compel you
to bow before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he blew over the young rye,
so that the thin stalks swayed to and
fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he then said, &#8220;the farmer
looks after his rye, for that&#8217;s <i>his</i>
business. But the rain and the sun
and I: we interest ourselves in all of
you alike, without distinction of persons.
For us the poor weeds are quite
as attractive as the rich corn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the farmer came out to look at
his rye and, when he saw the weeds
that stood in the fields, he was vexed
and scratched his head and began to
scold in his turn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s that dirty wind,&#8221; he said to
Jens and Ole, who stood beside him
with their hands in the pockets of
their new trousers.</p>

<p>But the wind dashed up and blew
off the hats of all three of them
and trundled them ever so far away.
The farmer and his boys ran after
them, but the wind was the quicker.
At last, he rolled the hats out into
the pond and the farmer and his boys
had to stand ever so long and fish for
them before they got them out.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE WATER-LILY AND
THE DRAGON-FLY</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">A</span> <small>LITTLE</small> stream ran between trees
and bushes. Along the banks stood
tall, slender reeds and whispered to
the wind. In the middle of the water
floated the water-lily, with her white
flower and her broad, green leaves.</p>

<p>Generally the water was very still,
but when, as sometimes happened,
the wind went for a trip over the
surface of the stream, then the reeds
rustled and the water-lilies dived
right down under the water and the
leaves flew up or to either side, so
that the thick green stalks, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
came all the way from the bottom,
found it difficult to hold them tight.</p>

<p>All day long, a dragon-fly grub
crept up and down the water-lily&#8217;s
stem.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a terrible bore it must be,&#8221;
said the grub, looking up at the flowers,
&#8220;to be a water-lily!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak of things which you
don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; replied the water-lily.
&#8220;It is just the pleasantest thing
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t understand that,&#8221;
said the grub. &#8220;I should always want
to be tearing myself free and flying
round like a great, splendid dragon-fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said the water-lily. &#8220;A
fine pleasure that would be! No, to
lie peacefully on the water and
dream and to drink sunshine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
now and again to rock upon the
waves: there&#8217;s some sense in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grub reflected for a moment
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have higher aspirations. If I
could have my way, I should be a
dragon-fly. I should skim over the
water on great stiff wings, kiss the
white flowers, rest for a second on
your leaves and then fly on again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ambitious,&#8221; said the water-lily,
&#8220;and that is silly. Wise people
know when they are well off.
May I make so free as to ask you
what you would propose to do to turn
into a dragon-fly? You don&#8217;t look as
if you were made for one. In any
case, you must see that you grow up
prettier; you&#8217;re very gray and ugly
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the pity of it,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
grub, a little disheartened. &#8220;I myself
don&#8217;t know how it is to happen; but
I still hope that it will. That&#8217;s why I
crawl around here and eat all the
little insects I can catch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, so you think you can eat yourself
into something big!&#8221; said the
water-lily, mockingly. &#8220;That would
be a pleasant way of improving one&#8217;s
condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I believe it&#8217;s the right way
for me!&#8221; cried the dragon-fly grub.
&#8220;I shall eat and eat all day, till I
grow stout and fat, and then, one
fine morning, I hope my fat will
change into wings with gold on them
and all the rest that a real dragon-fly
wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>The water-lily shook her wise white
head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let those foolish thoughts be,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
said, &#8220;and learn to be contented with
your lot. You can now live in peace
and quiet among my leaves and creep
up and down my stalk as much as
ever you like. You have plenty of
food and no cares nor worries: what
more can you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have an inferior nature,&#8221; answered
the grub, &#8220;and therefore you
have no sense of higher things. I
want to become a dragon-fly!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she crept down to the bottom
to catch lots of little insects and
eat herself fatter than ever.</p>

<p>The water-lily lay quietly on the
water and reflected:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand animals!&#8221; she
said to herself. &#8220;They do nothing but
dance about from morn till night,
hunt and eat one another and know
no moment&#8217;s peace. We flowers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
more sensible. We grow up calmly
and placidly, side by side, drink sunshine
and rain and take everything
as it comes. And I am the luckiest of
them all. How often have I not floated
contentedly here on the water,
while the other flowers were suffering
from the drought on land! We
flowers are by far the happier; but
that is what those stupid animals fail
to see.&#8221;</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>When the sun set in the evening,
the dragon-fly grub lay very still on
the stalk with her legs drawn up under
her. She had eaten a heap of insects
and was so fat that she felt as
though she would burst. And yet she
was not glad: she pondered on what
the water-lily had said and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sleep all night for restless thinking.
And all that reflecting made her head
ache, for it was a labour to which she
was not used. And she felt pains in
her back too and in her chest. It was
as though she were going to be pulled
to pieces and die on the spot.</p>

<p>When morning began to break, she
could bear it no longer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is,&#8221; she cried
in despair. &#8220;These pains hurt so that
I can&#8217;t think what is to become of
me. Perhaps the water-lily is right
and I shall never be more than a poor,
wretched grub. But the thought of
that is too terrible! I should so love
to turn into a dragon-fly and fly
about in the sun. Oh, my back, my
back! I <i>must</i> be dying!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she felt as if her back was
bursting and she screamed for pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
At the same moment, the reeds on
the bank began to rustle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the morning-wind,&#8221;
thought the grub. &#8220;At least, let me
see the sun once more before I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, with a great effort, she crawled
to one of the leaves of the water-lily,
stretched out her legs and prepared
for death.</p>

<p>But, when the sun had risen and
stood red and motionless in the east,
suddenly there came an opening right
in the middle of the grub&#8217;s back, accompanied
by a frightful itching.
Oh, the pain of it, the anguish! It
was a terrible feeling. Almost swooning,
she closed her eyes, but the agony
and the itching grew no less.
And then, suddenly, she perceived
that the pain was gone; and, when
she opened her eyes, she was hovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
through the air on stiff, glittering
wings, a brilliant dragon-fly!
Beneath her, on the leaf of the water-lily,
lay the ugly gray covering which
she had worn as a grub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried the new dragon-fly.
&#8220;Now the wish of my heart is
fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she flew through the air as
swiftly as though she meant to fly to
the end of the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hussy has got her way after
all!&#8221; thought the water-lily. &#8220;Now
we shall see if she is more contented
than before.&#8221;</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Two days later, the dragon-fly came
flying up and settled on the flowers
of the water-lily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said the water-lily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
&#8220;So you&#8217;ve come at last. I was
beginning to think that you had
grown too grand to come and see
your old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said the dragon-fly.
&#8220;Where shall I lay my eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll find a place somewhere,&#8221;
replied the flower. &#8220;Sit down first and
tell me if you are happier now than
when you were an ugly little grub
crawling up and down my stalk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I lay my eggs? Oh,
wherever can I lay my eggs?&#8221; cried
the dragon-fly and flew buzzing from
leaf to leaf, laying one here and one
there, and at last sat down, tired and
exhausted, on a leaf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the water-lily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was much better off then,&#8221;
sighed the dragon-fly. &#8220;The sunshine
is glorious and it is a great delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to fly over the water, but I
never have time to enjoy it. I tell you,
I&#8217;m awfully busy. In the old days,
I had nothing to think of. And now
I have to fly about all day long to
lay these silly eggs. I haven&#8217;t a moment
to myself and have hardly time
to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; cried the
water-lily, triumphantly. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I
prophesy that your happiness would
be no greater?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said the dragon-fly,
with a sigh. &#8220;I have no time to listen
to you: I must go and lay more
eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, just as she was about to fly
away, the starling came:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, I say, what a dear little
dragon-fly!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just a nice little
mouthful for my youngsters!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>And with a whizz! he snapped up
the dragon-fly in his beak and flew
away with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; cried the water-lily,
shaking her leaves with anger.
&#8220;Those animals, those animals! What
extraordinary creatures they are. I
must say I prefer my own quiet life.
I hurt nobody and no one injures me.
I am so hap....&#8221;</p>

<p>She got no further, for a boat glided
close past her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a lovely water-lily!&#8221; said
Ellen, who sat in the stern. &#8220;I must
have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent over the side and tore the
flower away. When she got home,
she put it into a glass of water, where
it stood for three days with a lot of
other flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the water-lily, on the fourth day. &#8220;I
have not fared a whit better than that
poor dragon-fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The flowers are faded,&#8221; said Ellen
and threw them out of the window.</p>

<p>And the water-lily lay with her fair
white petals on the dirty ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUNT EIDER-DUCK</h2></div>


<h3>1</h3>

<p><span class="xlarge">I</span><small>T</small> was winter.</p>

<p>The leaves were gone from the trees
and the flowers from the hedge. The
birds too were gone, that is to say
the more important ones; they had
all departed for the South.</p>

<p>But some, of course, had remained
behind.</p>

<p>There was the everlasting sparrow,
for instance, and the nimble little titmouse,
besides the crow and the raven,
who looked twice as black and
hungry against the snow. There were
also a few birds who preferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
take the rough with the smooth
rather than travel so far afield.</p>

<p>Down on the beach there was more
life than in summer.</p>

<p>There were the gulls who plunged
about, in great flocks, wherever a
hole had been made in the ice. And
there were the wild-duck, who swam
in the open water and quacked and
dived and flew up whenever a shot
was heard from the fishermen&#8217;s guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a crowd!&#8221; said the sparrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;They come from the North,&#8221; said
the gull. &#8220;From Norway and the
Faroe Islands, where it is a hundred
times colder than here. As soon as
there is the least bit of a change in
the temperature, they fly back again.
Do you know those two who are coming
this way over the ice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know them?&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the sparrow. &#8220;I was born last summer
and I only wish I were back in
the nest!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are eider-ducks,&#8221; said the
gull. &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s one more coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>So there was. And he was a very
handsome bird. He had a green neck,
a white throat and a white breast,
with a pink sheen on it, and lovely
yellow legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the drake,&#8221; said the gull.
&#8220;The other two are females and not
so smart, although they don&#8217;t look
bad either.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three eider-ducks had now come
so near that the sparrow and the gull
could hear what they were talking
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear lady,&#8221; said the drake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> &#8220;I cannot
understand why you stay on the
ice. Do come to the open water and
let us all enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must stay with my niece,&#8221; said
the elder eider-duck. &#8220;She is my sister&#8217;s
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should not Miss Eider-Duck
come too?&#8221; said the drake. &#8220;In
the summer, she was the gayest of
us all in the Faroes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was then,&#8221; said Miss Eider-Duck.
&#8220;But now I have begun to
think of other and more serious
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drake tried just a little longer
to persuade them, but to no purpose.
Then he flew back across the
ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there no cliffs here, auntie?&#8221;
asked the young eider-duck. &#8220;I am
dying to get married and to build a
nest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>&#8220;If I may venture to make a remark,&#8221;
said the sparrow, &#8220;I should
say that it is still a little too cold.
And there are no cliffs in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can brood in the sand,&#8221;
said the gull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for the information,
my good women,&#8221; said Aunt Eider-Duck.
&#8220;But it is only a fancy of my
niece&#8217;s. She is three years old now
and marriageable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said the sparrow. &#8220;I was
born last summer and, if it was only
a little warmer, I could get married
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easier for one than for another,&#8221;
said the aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us fly home to the Faroes and
get married, auntie,&#8221; said the young
duck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>&#8220;In a month&#8217;s time, my child,&#8221; said
auntie. &#8220;But I must decline the honour
for myself. I have now been married
seven times and have had enough
of it. Still, I will gladly chat about
it with you. That is so awfully interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trees will not be green yet in
a month,&#8221; said the sparrow. &#8220;This is
only January.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no trees in the Faroes,
my girl,&#8221; said auntie, &#8220;and we don&#8217;t
want them either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the young lady a sweetheart?&#8221;
asked the gull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said auntie. &#8220;But he&#8217;ll
come. You can get sweethearts for
the asking. She has spent her three
years dancing on the sea and having
a good time. One must see a little life
first.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>&#8220;If only she hits upon the right
one,&#8221; said the gull.</p>

<p>&#8220;All men are alike, my good
woman,&#8221; said auntie. &#8220;They court
you and marry you and, perhaps,
just lend a hand with the nest and
then they go off and leave the rest
to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I agree with you,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the gull. &#8220;My husband
has always helped me faithfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I got lots of flies from my
father when I was in the nest,&#8221; said
the sparrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were luckier than we,&#8221;
said auntie. &#8220;Not one of my seven
husbands so much as saw his young
ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said the sparrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we be going home to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Faroes soon?&#8221; asked Miss Eider-Duck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear, how interesting youth
is!&#8221; said auntie and flapped her
wings.</p>

<p>Then they flew into the water; but,
the next day, they came again and
this happened every day until well
into February. The young eider-duck&#8217;s
longing for home grew ever
greater and her aunt never tired of
talking to her about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s coming, now it&#8217;s coming!&#8221;
said she. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting almost
too hot here to bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said the sparrow,
shivering and longing for the spring.</p>

<p>One day, a charming young eider-drake
came and sat beside the two
ladies on the ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he proposes to you, accept him,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
whispered auntie. &#8220;He has the greenest
neck I&#8217;ve seen for many a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only he would!&#8221; said the young
girl.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>After sitting for a while and talking
of indifferent things, as long as
etiquette required&mdash;and etiquette
does not demand half as much of
eider-duck as it does of men&mdash;he
asked the young lady if she would be
his wife. He went on to talk of birds&#8217;-nests
and cliffs and dear little eggs
and so on, but she stopped him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; and so they were
engaged.</p>

<p>He was awfully eloquent and swore
to be faithful to her all his life and
to build a nest for her and to sit on
the eggs for her and to feed the children
from morn till night. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
nodded and could not speak for sheer
happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every word that he says is a lie,&#8221;
said auntie. &#8220;But, lord, how charming
it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; said the sparrow and
the gull. &#8220;Such a dear young lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fiddle!&#8221; said auntie. &#8220;We all
have to go through it. My seven husbands
all said the same and not one
of them kept his promise. But they
were charming, for all that. Only
they had not such green necks as this
one. He&#8217;s splendid. I could fall in
love with him myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we start?&#8221; asked Miss
Eider-Duck.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow early, my darling, if
the wind is fair,&#8221; said her beau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said auntie. &#8220;In
the first place, it&#8217;s more proper. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
then it&#8217;s so charming to see young
people so happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started the next morning.</p>

<p>It was not yet light when the birds
began their passage. Thousands of
eider-duck flew along in successive
flocks, while thousands more came up
from every side. The gull and the
sparrow woke up when they heard
the screaming and singing in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy going north in weather like
this!&#8221; said the sparrow, shivering.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s colder than ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s spring in the air when
one&#8217;s in love,&#8221; said the gull.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Day and night, the northward flight
proceeded.</p>

<p>There were so many birds that they
were quite bewildering to see and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
time passed and they neared their
destination, their longing increased
and they flew as though there were
fire under their wings. The aunt
never left the young couple and was
as light and swift as they and as
happy as if she herself were going to
be married for the eighth time.</p>

<p>At last they reached the Faroes,
which were their home.</p>

<p>They screamed and quacked for joy
when they saw the rocks rise from the
sea and their wings beat with renewed
vigour, tired though they were
by the long journey. They fell upon
the cliffs as upon a prey and soon
there was not a spot left but a happy
bird sat in it and flapped her wings
and screamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll show you a good place
for a nest,&#8221; said auntie to the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
pair, who sat exchanging loving
looks. &#8220;Come with me to the other
side of the rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>They flew with her and reached the
place where the man to whom the
rock belonged had put little wooden
boxes for the birds. There was just
one empty one left and the bridegroom
at once took possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you will be able to sit on the
eggs safely and comfortably, my
darling,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and you too,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember that you promised
to help me with my work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think I did!&#8221; said he and
kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how charming!&#8221; said auntie.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t want to live in that
nasty box,&#8221; said the young duck. &#8220;I
was looking forward most awfully to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
collecting sea-weed and straw and
heather, as you told me you used to
with your former wife. And that&#8217;s
what I want to do also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be easy, my dear little girl,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Of course, we will line the box
a bit, but let us be glad that there is
something to start on. Remember
that we have a long life before us,
full of work and happiness, and don&#8217;t
let us begin by doing more than we
shall be able to keep up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how he lies!&#8221; said auntie
and cast up her eyes to the sky. &#8220;But
how lovely it is to listen to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; asked the little
duck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was saying that your future husband
has the loveliest green neck in
all the Faroes,&#8221; said auntie. &#8220;I
should like to give it a little bite. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
now I will leave you to your happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she flew quacking over the
rock and splashed into the water with
the others. The two young people began
to line their box with what they
could find. Soon the wedding took
place, with mirth and pomp, and
thousands of other young eider-duck
were married on the same day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how beautiful it is to be
young!&#8221; said auntie, who was paying
wedding-visits with a swarm of
other old ladies.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>And the young couple were comfortable
and very happy. But, when
she had laid her first egg in the nest,
they had a tiff.</p>

<p>He wanted her to go for a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
trip with him over the rock, while the
egg lay in the nest, and she had no
objection, but she did think that he
might have shown rather more pleasure
at the sight of that fine gray-green
egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am saving up my emotions,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;as befits a man. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she said, however, that it was
out of the question to leave the egg
lying like that, with nothing over it.
They must cover it with something.
She plucked some fine down from
under her wings and laid it on the
egg. But when she asked him to do
the same, he shook his head with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am saving up my feathers,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You will lay four more eggs
and my turn will come when you&#8217;ve
rim out of down. I shall pluck myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
bald if it&#8217;s for the good of our
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, how he&#8217;s romancing!&#8221; said
auntie, who was standing near and
heard all they said. &#8220;He&#8217;s just like
my own husbands. They don&#8217;t mean
a word of it, but still it does an old
heart good to hear them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young wife now accompanied
her husband to the beach, where all
was life and jollity.</p>

<p>Scores of husbands were there with
their wives and all the old gentlemen
and ladies who no longer had a nest.
They dived and chatted and told
funny stories. But the young wife
mostly sat apart or talked to the
other young wives, who also were in
a rather solemn mood. And soon she
declared that she must positively lay
another egg.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;Come, dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come, let
us go home. There&#8217;s a new egg coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a misfortune!&#8221; said her husband,
who was in the midst of a
quadrille with a couple of young
ducks of the summer before, who
were not yet thinking of marriage.</p>

<p>But he went back with her to the
nest and she laid her egg. She
plucked some more down, while he
addressed her in beautiful and touching
phrases, and then they went out
again, for he simply could not stay
at home in the nest.</p>

<p>But they had not gone half-way
when she felt another egg coming
and told him so.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better stay up there in
the nest,&#8221; he said, crossly. &#8220;This
running to and fro does not amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
me and is bad for the children&#8217;s
health.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you stay with me?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come and have a look at you
as often as I can,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the way you keep the
promises you made me!&#8221; said she and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own darling little wife!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help you the least little
bit with the eggs. You&#8217;ve got to
lay them and lay them you must. My
work for our dear children and for
yourself will begin when the eggs are
all laid and you have started hatching
them. And then, of course, when
the little darlings come out, they will
have to be fed and taught how to get
on in the world. I am saving up my
strength till that time comes, you see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
And then I will sit on the eggs, while
you go for a nice little trip and play
about with the others down below.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear the like?&#8221; said
auntie. &#8220;How beautifully he talks!
You&#8217;ve got a really nice husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the young wife went back
to the nest alone and laid her third
egg. Auntie flew down to the beach
with the husband:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look after him, dear,&#8221; she whispered;
&#8220;trust me for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the fourth egg came and
the fifth.</p>

<p>She had plucked all the feathers
from her breast that she thought she
could spare and placed them in a
nice little, mouse-gray heap around
the eggs. Then she sat upon them
herself and brooded and brooded. At
first, from time to time, she went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the edge of the cliff to look down at
the beach, where her husband was
with the other men and the ladies
who had no eggs. But she did this
less and less often. She took no food,
grew thin and brooded and brooded.
Her aunt called every day to have
a chat with her.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>One day, the husband came and sat
down by the nest. He looked very
spruce with his green neck and his
bright eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how are you getting on?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I despise you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Go away
and never show your face to me
again. You coaxed me with your fair
promises and not one of them have
you kept. I have had to pluck all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
down I wanted from my own breast.
I&#8217;ve been sitting here alone, day after
day, while you&#8217;ve been amusing
yourself with all those revellers on
the beach. You haven&#8217;t brought me a
bite of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush!&#8221; he said, scratching in the
sand with his fine, yellow feet. &#8220;I
shall be pleased to bring you a small
mussel from time to time, if that
gives you any satisfaction. But, for
goodness&#8217; sake, don&#8217;t be so formal!
Do you really imagine that men
weigh their words when they&#8217;re engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of this!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want my children to see their
unnatural father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as for that, I wouldn&#8217;t give a
straw to see that callow brood,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;And, upon my word, you&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
no beauty yourself! You&#8217;re so lean
and full of bald spots. You&#8217;re very
different from the pretty girl I fell
in love with.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was about to fly up out of the
nest and give him one for himself;
but she lay as though rooted to the
floor and stared at a man who put his
head over the edge of the cliff. Her
husband flew away with a loud
scream and auntie did the same. But
the man hardly gave them a glance.
He scrambled up the rock and set
down a great basket, which he carried,
beside the nest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fine nest!&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
down enough here to stuff a little pillow
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked the
eider-duck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; said the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
&#8220;It would be silly of me to do you
any harm; why, I put the box here
for you myself. I only want the
down that&#8217;s in your nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried the bird, spreading
out her wings and holding on to the
nest as fast as she could. &#8220;What
should I do with my children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, pluck some more down from
your pretty breast, my dear,&#8221; said
the man, kindly. &#8220;Now stand aside
and let me get by, without any nonsense.
After all, I&#8217;m the stronger
of the two and the nest belongs to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the young eider-duck did not
stir from her place. She pecked at his
hands with her beak and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go down to the beach and catch
my husband and my old aunt! Kill
them, if you like, and take all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
down. It&#8217;s only what they deserve.
But you must let my down be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff, my pet!&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;The best down is what a mother
plucks from her breast. We all know
that. And, if your children have to
do without, it will come in useful for
other children, dainty little human
children, whose parents can afford to
buy the softest little pillows for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least, wait until my children
are ready!&#8221; cried the eider-duck in
despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice thing!&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;What, let you lie there and spoil the
down? Come, clear out!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed her aside, took all the
down, put it in his basket and went
away, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pluck some more feathers if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
want them for your young. That&#8217;s
what a good mother always does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she went to the edge of the
rock and looked out.</p>

<p>The eider-duck were disporting
themselves gloriously. She could distinctly
see her husband and her aunt
diving and amusing themselves as
though life were a sheer enjoyment.
And all the others were doing the
same: not one of them thought that
there was a man up above emptying
all the nests of their precious down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up here and pluck your
breast!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;Now is the
time to keep some of your promises.
Your eggs are lying bare and cold,
while you are enjoying yourself
down there, you wretch!&#8221;</p>

<p>But her voice died away in the noise
of the wind and surf. No one heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
her cries or beheld her despair. She
remembered that the eggs were
really getting cold, while she stood
there, and she hurried back to the
nest.</p>

<p>One of the eggs began to burst and
soon a tiny beak peeped out of the
hole in the shell. She now flew to help
the little chap out. She stood gazing
at him for a moment and saw what
a darling he was. And then, like a
mad thing, she began to pluck the
last remaining feathers from her
breast and every part of her and laid
them round the little fellow. She
ceased complaining and thought only
of how she could make her children
warm and comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Two days later, all the five young
ones were out.</p>

<p>The young mother saw with pride
how smart they were. Already, they
stretched out their feet, which had
a delicate web between the toes,
yawned, lifted their little wings and
even quacked a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go to the beach at once,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I am sure that there are no
prettier children on the whole rock.
But, should you meet your wretch of
a father, mind you look the other
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went down the rock and the five
little ones followed so nimbly that it
was a joy to see. Half-way down,
she met her aunt:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;I was just coming up to see you,&#8221;
said the old lady. &#8220;I say, what darlings
your five children are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they dears?&#8221; said the
mother, who forgot all her rage when
she heard her aunt&#8217;s praises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take one of them to walk
with,&#8221; said auntie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while I live!&#8221; said the mother,
severely. &#8220;I know too well how
flighty you are, auntie. My children
are mine and nobody else&#8217;s and mine
they shall remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a shot rang
out through the air.</p>

<p>It was a silly shot, fired at random
by a silly boy who wanted to show
off his father&#8217;s gun. But the gun was
loaded and the shot spread and
Mother Eider-Duck sank to the
ground with a scream.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;My young ones! My young ones!&#8221;
she moaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all right, all five of them,&#8221;
said auntie. &#8220;Be easy. But what&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dying,&#8221; said the mother. &#8220;I
am full of shot. I know for certain
that I&#8217;m dying. Oh, my children, my
children!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about them,&#8221; said
auntie. &#8220;I shall be a mother to them
in your stead and look after them as
if they were my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, auntie,&#8221; said the mother, in a
feeble voice, &#8220;you are so terribly
frivolous. I have seen you myself
from up there, playing and fooling
about with the men and the girls on
the beach. How can a mother trust
her children to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
auntie. &#8220;Surely, it&#8217;s quite different
when one has children to care for.
You just die in peace, do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>And that is what Mother Eider-Duck
did.</p>

<p>She sank into herself and only just
had time to take a last look at her
children. But her aunt did not even
wait till she was quite dead. She forgot
everything, except that she had
suddenly got five beautiful children,
and at once walked off with them to
the beach. She knew the nearest way,
because she had already been there
several times with children. She made
the road easy for them and helped
them in every possible manner, fondling
them with her beak and praising
or scolding them according to their
deserts.</p>

<p>By the time that their mother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
closed her eyes, the children were
down on the beach.</p>

<p>They at once swam and dived in a
way that was a joy to see. Auntie
watched over them and almost burst
with pride. An old beau came up and
asked her to take a walk with him,
but she gave him a smart rap with
her beak:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see the children, you old
coxcomb?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Get out of this,
or I&#8217;ll teach you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she remained with the children
until they were able to take care of
themselves. She travelled to the South
with them, winter after winter, and
listened to the men courting them
and befooling them, just as their
father had done to their mother. She
showed them good places for their
nests, paid wedding-visits and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
honoured and esteemed all over the
rock, until, one day, a sea-eagle came
and caught her and gobbled her up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
